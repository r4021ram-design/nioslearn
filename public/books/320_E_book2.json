Education  is  an  instrument  of\nchange. The right type of education at right time can bring about positivity in the\noutlook  of  society,  attitudinal  changes  to  face  the  new/fresh  challenges  and  the\ncourage to face difficult situations.\nThis can be very effectively achieved by the curriculum renewal at regular intervals\nof time. A static curriculum does not serve any purpose, as it does not cater to the\ncurrent needs and aspirations of the individual and society.\nFor  this  purpose  only,  educationists  from  all  over  the  country  come  together  at\nregular intervals to deliberate on the issues of changes needed and required. As an\noutcome  of  such  deliberations,  the  National  Curriculum  Framework  (NCF  2005)\ncame out, which spells out in detail the type of education desirable/needed at various\nlevels of education – primary, elementary, secondary or senior secondary.\nKeeping this framework and other national and societal concerns in mind, we have\ncurrently revised the curricula of Accountancy course at Senior Secondary Level, as\nper the Common Core Curriculum developed by COBSE (Council of Boards of School\nEducation) and NCERT (National Council for Educational Research and Training)\nmaking  it  current  and  need  based.  Textual  material  production  is  an  integral  and\nessential part of all NIOS programmes offered through open and distance learning\nsystem.  Therefore,  we  have  taken  special  care  to  make  the  learning  material  user\nfriendly,  interesting  and  attractive  for  you.\nI  would  like  to  thank  all  the  eminent  persons  involved  in  making  this  material\ninteresting and relevant to your needs.

For this financial statements are prepared called income statement and position statement.\nThese are called Final accounts. Small business enterprises generally do not follow double\nentry system hence the method of accounting followed by them is called single entry system.\nTheir method of preparing final accounts (financial statements) is different from business entities\nwhose accounts are based on double entry system. They prepare trading and profit & loss\naccount to know the performance results of business and Balance Sheet to know the net capital\nemployed in business.\nNot for profit organisations like clubs, hospitals, schools etc too prepare final accounts such as\nIncome and Expenditure account to know the result of these activities in the form of surplus or\ndeficit and Balance Sheet to ascertain the financial position. While preparing financial statements\nsome adjustments are required to be made. Prominent among them are depreciation-position\nof the value of fixed asset to be appropriated to are accounting year and provision and reserves\n- position of profits to be appropriated to provisions for some expected expenses and losses\nand regime to meet contingencies.\nThus this module is so designed that it trains the learners how to prepare final accounts from\nincomplete records, of business entities following double entry system and of not for profit\norganisations.

Assets are broadly divided\ninto two categories- current assets (cash, debtors or customers balances, stock of\nmaterials and goods) and fixed assets (buildings, furniture and fixtures, machinery and\nplant, motor vehicles).\nFixed assets are also called long term assets as they provide benefits to the business for\nmore than one year. Most fixed assets lose their value over time as these are put in use\nand as the years pass by. The fixed assets lose their usefulness due to arrival of new\ntechnologies and change of fashions etc. These are then generally required to be replaced,\nas their useful life is over. Hence, the cost of a fixed asset is allocated over its useful life.\nEach year’s allocation of the cost is charged as depreciation expense for that year.\nFor example an office chair is purchased for ` 2,500 and it is estimated that after ten\nyears it will be scraped. The useful life of the chair is ten years over which the cost of `\n2,500 will be distributed. Each year’s allocation may be calculated as ` 250.\nThus, ` 250 is the depreciation expense for each year.\nDepreciation, thus, is an expense charged during a year for the reduction in the value of\nfixed assets, arising due to:\n Normal wear and tear out of its use and passage of time\n Obsolescence due to change in technology, fashion, taste and other market\nconditions\n   14.2 CAUSES  OF  DEPRECIATION\nFollowing are the causes for which depreciation is provided :\ni)    Normal wear and tear\n(a)  Due to usage - Every asset has a life for which it can run, produce or give\nservice. Thus, as we put the asset to use its worth decreases. Like decrease in\nthe efficiency and functioning of a bicycle due to its running and usage.\n(b)  Due to passage of Time – As the time goes by elements of nature, wind, sun,\nrain etc, cause physical deterioration in the worth of an asset. Like reduction in\nthe worth of a piece of furniture due to passage of time even when it is not\nused.\nii)   Obsolescence\n(a)  Due to development of improved or superior equipment : Sometimes fixed\nassets are required to be discarded before they are actually worn out due to\neither of the above reasons. Arrival of superior equipments and machines etc.\nDepreciation"

This makes older equipments worthless\nas production of goods with their use will be costlier and non competitive. For\nexample, Steam engines became obsolete with the arrival of diesel and electric\nlocomotives.\n(b)  Due to change in fashion, style, taste or market conditions : Obsolescence may\nalso result due to decline in demand for certain goods and services with a\nchange in fashion, style, taste or market conditions. The goods and services\nthat are no longer in  vogue  lead to decrease in the value of the assets which\nwere engaged in their production  -  like factories or machines meant for making\nold fashioned hats, shoes, furniture etc.\nLoss in the value of fixed assets for such reasons is called obsolescence and also\ncharged as depreciation.\n    14.3 OBJECTIVES  OF  CHARGING  DEPRECIATION\nFollowing are the objectives of charging depreciation of Assets:\ni)    To show the True Financial Position of the Business : Fixed Assets have some\neffective working life during which it can be economically operated. Depreciation is\nthe gradual loss in the value of fixed assets. If depreciation is not provided, profit and\nloss A/c will not disclose the true profit made during the accounting period. At the\nsame time, the Balance Sheet will not disclose the true Financial position as Fixed\nassets appearing in the Balance Sheet will be over valued. If depreciation in ignored\nyear after year, ultimately when asset is worn out, the proprietor will not be is a\nposition to continue the business smoothly.\nii)   To retain funds in the business for replacement of the asset : Net profit is the\nyield of the capital invested by proprietor and may be wholly withdrawn by him in\nthe form of cash. If depreciation is provided, this figure of net profit will be reduced\nand the amount withdrawn by the proprietor will also be decreased. As such the\ncash equivalent to the charge for depreciation will be left over in the business. This\naccumulated amount will enable the proprietor to replace to a new asset.\nFill in the blanks :\ni.Depreciation represents a __________ in the value of fixed assets.\nINTEXT  QUESTIONS  14.1\nDepreciation"

For example expenses\non loading, carriage, installation, transportation and unloading of the asset up to the\npoint of its location, expense on its erection and assembly.\nii)   Useful Life of the Asset : Useful life is the expected number of years for which\nthe asset will remain in use.\niii)Scrap Value : Scrap value is the residual value at which the asset could be sold to\nscrap dealer (Kabari) after its useful life.\niv)  Depreciable value of asset : Depreciable value is the cost of asset minus the\nscrap value.\nIllustration 1\nA generator was purchased for ` 5,00,000.   ` 1,500 was paid for the crane for its\nloading on the truck, ` 7,000 was paid for transporting the generator to the factory\n. `\n2,000 was spent on its unloading at the factory site. The generator was estimated to\nrun for 10 years and thereafter would be saleable for ` 60,000. Calculate the depreciable\nvalue of the generator.\nThe cost of the asset is :\nPurchase price` 5,00,000\nExpenses on Loading` 1,500\nTransportation` 7,000\nExpenses on unloading` 2,000\nTotal\n``\n``\n` 5,10,500\nThe useful life of the generator is 10 years\nDepreciation"

Straight Line Method\nand  ii.  Diminishing Balance Method\nStraight Line Method of Charging Depreciation\nUnder this method, the amount of depreciation is uniform from year to year. Suppose,\nif an asset costs ` 1,00,000 and depreciation is fixed @ 10%, then    ` 10,000 would\nbe written off every year. That is why this method is also called ‘Fixed Installment\nMethod’ or ‘Original Cost Method’. In this method, the amount to be written off every\nyear is arrived at as under:\nOut of the cost of the asset, its scrap value is deducted and it is divided by the number\nof years of its estimated life.\nFor example: a machine is purchased for ` 1,20,000 and it is estimated that its useful\nlife is 10 years. After its useful life its scrap value is ` 20,000. Depreciation of one year\ncan be calculated as under:\nIf its scrap can not be sold or no money can be realized from its scrap, then depreciation\nof one year is:\nIn this method the amount of depreciation is same for each year. Therefore, this method\nis called Straight Line Method, Fixed Installment Method or Original Cost Method.\nIllustration 2\nA machine was purchased on January 1, 2011 for ` 1,00,000 and its useful life is 10\nyears. After completing its useful life the machine will be scraped and nothing will be\nrealized from it. It is decided to charge depreciation on this machine @ 10% p. a. on\nStraight Line Method.\nCalculate amount of depreciation for each year during the useful life of this machine.\nDepreciation of Each Year =\nCost of Assets \n Estimated Scrap Value\nNumber of years of expected life\nDepreciation of one Year =\n` ` \n` ` \n` 1,20,000  \n` ` \n` ` \n` 20,000\n` ` \n` ` \n` 10\n  =  \n``\n``\n` 10,000\nDepreciation of one Year =\n` ` \n` ` \n` 1,20,000\n` ` \n` ` \n` 10\n  =  \n``\n``\n` 12,000\nDepreciation"

Hence, this method is simple and\ncalculations are easier to understand.\nii)   Asset is completely Written Off : Under this method, the book value of an\nasset is reduced to net scrap value or zero value. In other words, in the books of\naccounts the value of the asset at the end of its useful life is equal to zero or its\nresidual value.\nLimitations  of  Straight  Line  Method\ni)    Difficulty in Computation : When there are various machines having different\nlife-spans, the computation of depreciation becomes complicated because the\ndepreciation on each machine will have to be calculated separately for each asset.\nii)   Illogical : It is well known that the expense on its repairs and maintenance increases\nas the asset becomes older\n.

Under straight line method the total burden on Profit and Loss Account in\ncomparision to earlier years is _____________.\n(2)  Diminishing  Balance  Method\nUnder this method, as the value of asset goes on diminishing year after year, the amount\nof depreciation charged every year goes on declining. The amount of depreciation is\ncalculated as a fixed percentage of the diminishing value of the asset shown in the\nbooks at the beginning of each year. Under this method the value of an asset never\ncomes to zero.\nSuppose, the cost of the asset is ` 40,000 and the percentage to be written off each\nyear is 10%. In the first year the amount of the depreciation will be ` 4,000 i.e., 10%\nof ` 40,000. This will reduce the book value to ` 36,000 i.e. ` 40,000 –  ` 4,000.\nNow, at the beginning of the next year the book value is ` 36,000. The amount of the\ndepreciation for the next year will be ` 3,600, i.e., 10% of ` 36,000. Thus, every\nyear the amount of the depreciation will go on reducing. This method of charging\ndepreciation is also known as Reducing Balance Method or written down value\nmethod.\nINTEXT  QUESTIONS  14.2\nDepreciation"

Hence, in order to\nascertain the net profit for each year, businessmen need to take into account not only the\ncurrent contingencies but future contingencies also. In fact, provisions and reserves are\nsuch considerations which actually relate to the future needs for which a part of the\ncurrent earnings has to be set aside.\nAfter studying this lesson you will be able to\n \nunderstand the meaning and need of provision;\n understand the meaning and objectives of reserves;\n explain types of reserves and\n know the difference between provisions and reserves.\n   15.1 PROVISION  :  MEANING  AND  NEED\nAs you know in our daily routine life we make various arrangements for the future\nexpected needs. For example, if your father wants to give you higher education such as\nEngineering, Doctorate, or any other professional course, he will need a lot of money.\nNow question arises how would your father be able to arrange such an amount? Yes,\nyou are thinking right, he will start saving money from today and every year he will do\nthe same.

The amount which is\nkept separately to meet such expected losses/expenses is called a Provision.\nIf an amount is payable in the future and the amount is certain, it is a liability. For\nexample, October month’s rent, totalling ` 2,000. is payable on 31\nst\n October. The\nenterprise will debit Rent Account and Credit Rent Outstanding Account as it is a\ndefinite liability. However, if the amount in respect of a liability or expected loss is not\ncertain, an estimated amount is set aside by debiting the Profit and Loss Account. The\namount so set aside is known as a Provision. Thus, ‘Provision’ means an estimated\namount to meet an uncertain loss or expense in future. Some of the examples of\nProvisions are: Provision for Doubtful Debts on Debtors, Provision for Discount on\nDebtors, Provision for Depreciation.\nNeeds of Provision\nProvisions are provided for:\ni)Depreciation, renewal or reduction in the value of assets.\nii)   A known liability, the amount of which cannot be determined with substantial\naccuracy.\niii)   A disputed claim.\niv)  Specific loss on realization of an asset or on payment of taxes.\nv)   Redeeming the liability.\nvi)  Writing off bad-debts/doubtful debts.\nvii)Contingent liabilities.\nGeneral rules in creation of Provisions:\ni)It is created by debiting the profit and loss account.\nii)   It is created to meet a known liability or a specific contingency, e.g. ‘Provision for bad\nand doubtful debts’ and ‘provision for depreciation’ etc.\niii)   A  provision is created irrespective of whether there is profit or loss in the business.\niv)  It is not available for distribution as dividend among shareholders.\nv)   A provision is made for a definite amount and, therefore, a definite sum is set aside\nevery year to meet the known contingency.\nvi)  Making of a provision is  must to meet known liability or contingency.\nvii)The provision is generally shown on the liability side of the balance sheet.\nProvision and Reserves"

Balance sheet is a statement\nwhich shows the financial position of a business organisation on a particular date which\nis generally the last date of the accounting period. Financial position of a business unit\nis the amount of claims against the resources of business. These resources are cash,\nstock of goods, furniture, machinery, etc. The claims include the claims of the owner\ncapital and the claims of outsiders such as creditors, bankers, etc. Therefore, it can be\nstated that Balance Sheet is the statement which shows assets owned by the business\nand liabilities owed by it on a particular date. Balance Sheet is not an account. It has\ntwo sides. (i) Assets side and (ii) the Liabilities side. The Asset side has a list of fixed as\nwell current assets. The liabilities side has a list of items of capital, long term as well as\nshort term liabilities.\nNeed\n1.Balance Sheet is prepared to measure the true financial position of a business\nentity at a particular point of time.\n2.It is a systematic presentation of what a business unit owns and what it owes.\n3.Balance Sheet shows the financial position of the concern at a glance.\n4.Creditors, financiers are particularly interested in the Balance Sheet of a concern\nso that they can decide whether to deal with the concern or not.\nGrouping of Assets and Liabilities\nAll the assets can be categorised in following groups :\n1.Current Assets\n2.Liquid Assets\n3.Non-current Assets\n4.Tangible Assets\n5.Intangible Assets\nFinancial Statements : I"

Liabilities can be of two types owners liability or capital and outsiders liabilities\nsuch as creditors, bills payable, Bank Loan etc.\nThere is no prescribed form in which a Balance Sheet should be prepared by a sole\nproprietary business or a partnership firm. However, an order is generally maintained\nin which assets and liabilities are written. This is to maintain uniformity/consistency\nwhich facilitates comparative analysis for decision making. Balance sheet may be\nprepared in any of the following orders :\n(a) Liquidity order(b) Permanency order\n(a)  Liquidity  Order\nLiquidity means convertibility of assets into cash. Every asset cannot be converted into\ncash at the same degree of ease and convenience. Assets are written in the order of\ntheir liquidity, Assets of highest liquidity is written first and next highest follows and so\non. Similarly, liabilities are also written in this very order.

Income statement shows the Net\nProfit or Net loss as the case may be for that period and Position Statement presents\nthe financial position of the business on the specific date. These statements are prepared\non the basis of Trial Balance and other information. It is possible that there are certain\nitems of income or expenses which do not pertain to the accounting period for which\nTrial Balance is prepared or other such items which have accrued but have not been\naccounted for and hence are not reflected in Trial Balance. Both these types of incomes\nand expenses are to be fully accounted for, only then the above stated two statements\nwill show the true and fair position of the business.

It needs to be ensured that such items of income\nand expenditure which do not pertain to the said accounting period, should not to be\nincluded. If some of these items have been included in the trial balance these must be\nexcluded by making necessary adjusting entry. Similarly, there can be items which are\nleft out and are needed to be accounted for. Adjustment entry will also be made for\nthem. This is necessary in order to calculate the correct profit or loss and to show true\nand fair financial position of the business. For example, a firm closes its books on March\n31, every year, Suppose it has not paid rent of the shop for the month of March. This\nwill not be reflected in Trial Balance and hence it needs to be accounted for as it relates\nto the year for which accounts are being prepared. Similarly, suppose annual insurance\npremium has been paid up to June, 30. It means premium for three months has been\npaid in advance. This is included in the item of insurance appearing in the Trial Balance.\nThis amount paid in advance needs to be excluded. This process of exclusion or inclusion\nof items into books of accounts at the time of preparing finanacial statements is called\nadjustments. These are to be incorporated to arrive at the true and fair position of the\nbusiness.\nFill in the blanks with suitable word/words :\n(i)Trading and Profit & Loss Account shows the ............... or ...............\n(ii)Adjustments are necessary to show the correct ............... and ............... of a\nbusiness concern.\n(iii)Items of income and expenditure which do not pertain to the accounting period\nshould be ...............\n(iv)Items of income & expenditure which relate to the accounting period but are left\nout should be ...............\n  18.2  ADJUSTMENTS  AND  THEIR  INCORPORATION\nThe number and nature of adjustments differ from organisation to organisation. It depends\nupon the volume and nature of activities in the organisation, However, certain adjustments\nare common in all types of organisations. Moreover, while making adjustments you will\nhave to follow the general principle of double entry i.e. the amount is to be debited to\none account and credited to another account. Thus in the finanacial statements the item\nto be adjusted should appear at two places one representing the debit and the other\nrepresenting the credit.\nINTEXT  QUESTIONS  18.1\nFinancial Statements : II"

It will be a sound accounting practice that a suitable amount is kept aside in\nthe current year to meet the possible loss of bad debts in the next year.

So a provision for bad and doubtful\ndebt is made on the debtors of a year at a fixed percentage say 5%. This percentage\nmay change if the circumstances have changed. For example, it may be reduced if the\nbusinessman has become selective in selling goods on credit.\nProvision for bad and doubtful debt is maintained at every year at a fixed percentage of\nthe debtors.

Provision  for  Discount  on  Debtors\nDebtors outstanding at the end of year make payment in the next year and they may\nbe entitled to cash discount if they make the payment by the due date. Because, the\ndebt has arisen during the year, the discount is to be taken as expense for the year.\nThus a Provision for Discount on Debtors is made.\nThe process is same as for the provision for doubtful debt. The likely amount of the\ndiscount to be allowed is debited to the Profit and Loss Account and credited to\nthe Provision for Discount Account. This amount is deducted from book debts\n(debtors) in the balance sheet and is carried forward to the next year. Discount allowed\nto the existing debtors in the next year are debited to the Provision for Discount\nAccount and not to the Profit and Loss Account. The debit reduces the balance in\nthe provision account, it is made up to the required figure by a debit to the Profit\n& Loss Account and credit to the provisions account just like the Provision for\nDoubtful Debts Account.\nAn important point to note is that discount is not allowed on debts that became bad.\nTherefore, the provision for discount is made for good debts only. In other words,\nthe amount of the Provision for Discount is calculated after deducting bad debts and\nthe provision for doubtful debts from sundry debtros. Suppose, sundry debtors total\n` 1,00,000; provision for doubtful debts is required at 5% and provision for discounts\nat 2.5%. So first we have to calculate provision for doubtful debts i.e. ` 1,00,000\nx 5% = ` 5,000; the remaining amount is ` 95,000. Now we calculate Provision\nfor Discount on Debtors i.e. ` 95,000 x 2.5% it will be ` 2,375.\nAccounting Treatment\n(i)For Discount Allowed :\nDiscount Allowed A/cDr.\nTo Debtors A/c\n(Being discount allowed to debtors)\n(ii)For transferring the amount of discount to profit & loss Account.\nProfit & Loss A/cDr.\nTo Discount Allowed\n(Being discount allowed transferred to Profit & Loss A/c)\nFinancial Statements : II"

Manager’s Commission\nSometimes, the manager is entitled to a commission on profits which is usually calculated\nas a fixed percentage of the profits. Suppose, the profit earned by the firm is ` 80,000\nwithout considering the commission which is at 5%. The commission will be then\n` 4,000. The profit will be reduced to ` 76,000. As the amount of commission ` 4,000\nis still to be paid, it should be treated as an outstanding expense. Accordingly, the entry\nis:\nProfit and Loss A/c...Dr.\nTo Commission Payable or Outstanding Commission A/c\nCommission Payable is a current liability and is shown in the Balance Sheet.\nSometimes, however, the commission is calculated on profits remaining finally after the\ncommission. If the rate of the commission is 5%, and the profit remaining after the\ncommission is ` 100; then the profit before the commission will be ` 105. That is in this\ncase the commission of ` 5 should be out of every ` 105 of profit before the commission.\nThe formula to calculate the commission in such a case is :\nNet Profit before charging the Commission\nPercentage of the commission\n100 + Percentage of the commission\nx\nFinancial Statements : II"

Abnormal  Losses\nSuch losses occur because of fire, earthquakes or accidents. These may destroy some\nfixed assets of the firm. In such  case an Asset Account is credited and the Profit and\nLoss Account is debited. The debit may be spread over two or three years.\nStock of goods may also be destroyed or damaged by fire, or other causes. It is\nobvious that because of this, the value of the stock will be lower than otherwise. This\nwill reduce the amount of gross and net profit. It is, however, better to ascertain the\ngross profit which would have been earned without the loss since this enables the firm\nto judge its trading operations properly. To nullify the effect of loss of stock, the Trading\nAccount is credited with the cost of the goods destroyed. If the goods destroyed are\nnot insured then the cost price of the goods destroyed is debited to Profit and Loss\nAccount. If the goods are insured, then the claim admitted by the insurance company is\ndeducted and the claim not admitted is debited to the Profit and Loss Account.

These organisations provide services to their members\nand to the public in general. Their main source of income is membership fees, subscrip-\ntion, donation, grant-in-aid, etc. As the money is involved in the activities of these\norganisations, they also maintain accounts.

But at the end of the year they\nprepare a summary of cash transactions based on the cash-book. This summary is\nprepared in the form of an account. It is called Receipts and Payments account. All\ncash receipts and payments are recorded in this account whether these belong to cur-\nrent year or next year or previous year. All receipts and payments are recorded in this\naccount whether these are of revenue nature or capital nature. As it is an account so it\nhas the debit side and the credit side. All receipts are recorded on its debit side while all\npayments are shown on the credit side. This account begins with opening cash or/and\nbank balance. Closing balance of this account is cash in hand and or cash at bank/\noverdraft.

In case\nthe expenditure side exceeds the income side, the difference is ‘deficit’.\nNeed of preparing Income and Expenditure Account\nEven the Not for Profit Organisations would like to know the net result of their activities\nof a particular period which generally is one year. Though such organisations do not\nengage in trading activities and their objective is not earning profits, yet they would like\nto know whether income exceeds expenditure or vice a versa. The amount of the such\ndifference is not termed as Net Profit or Net Loss as it is so termed in case of business\norganisations. In case of Not for Profit organisations the net result is termed as ‘surplus’\nor ‘deficit’ as the case may be. Moreover of a preparation of Income and Expenditure\nAccount is a legal requirement.

Another system of recording\ntransactions called Single Entry System also exists, under which both the aspects of\na transaction may not be recorded. Unlike Double Entry System in Single Entry\nsystem, no set rules are followed. Even the books of account to be maintained are\nnot certain. Usually, under this system the cash book and personal ledgers are\nmaintained : real and nominal accounts are not. In this system because both the aspects\nof transactions are not recorded the system is known as ‘Accounts from Incomplete\necords’ or ‘Single Entry System of Accounting’. Sometimes accounts that had been\nmaintained, on double entry system may be rendered incomplete because of the\nhappening of certain events like fire, floods, earthquakes etc. Accounting records that\nare not maintained according to Double Entry System are known as Accounts from\nIncomplete Records or Single Entry System of Accounting.\nAfter  studying  this  lesson  you  will  be  able  to:\nlstate the meaning of Single Entry System;\nlexplain uses and limitations of Single Entry System/Accounts from Incomplete\nRecords;\nlexplain ascertainment of profit/loss by conversation method.\nlascertainment of profit /loss by statement of affairs method;\nlascertain the missing figures of total debtors, total creditors, B/R A/c and Cash\nBook;\nOBJECTIVES"

This is not ture.\nThe fact remains that under this system, while for certain transactions both the aspects\nare recorded, for others only one aspect is recorded and some trasactions are even\nignored.\nFeatures\nThe features of the Single Entry System are as follows :\ni.Suitability : This system is suitable for small businesses such as sole trader or\npartnership firm. Limited companies due to legal provisions, cannot maintain\naccounting books on Single Entry System.\nii.Preparation of Cash Book : Generally, a Cash Book is prepared in this system\nin which business as well as private transactions are mixed up.\niii.    Preparation of Personal Accounts : Normally under this system, only personal\naccounts are prepared and real and nominal accounts are avoided.\niv.    No Uniformity : This system may differ from firm to firm, because same\nprinciples are not followed by all the enterprises.\nv.Requirement of Original Vouchers : Usually under this system, we have to\ndepend on originally vouchers for collecting the necessary informations.\nvi.    Preparation of Final Accounts : In the absence of all nominal and real accounts\nthe final accounts cannot be prepared easily. It is posible after converting the\navailable information into double entry system and missing amounts are determined\nthen Trading & Profit & Loss A/c can be prepared. The amount of all assets\nand all liabilities can also be computed from incomplete records, but they are\nbased on estimates. That is the reason that the statement of assets and liabilities\nprepared  under  this  system  at  the  end  of  an  accounting  period  is  called  a\nStatement of Affairs instead of Balance Sheet.\nAccounts From Incomplete Records"

Suitable for Small Concerns : It is mainly suited to small business concerns\nwith limited number of transactions and very few assets and liabilities.\niv.    No Need of Knowledge of Principles of Book Keeping : Under Single Entry\nSystem, accounting records can be easily maintained as their maintenance does\nnot require knowledge of the principles of book keeping.\nv.Easy to Ascertain Profit or Loss : Ascertainment of profit or loss in much\neasier. To ascertain profit or loss, the proprietor has to compare the financial\nposition of business at the close of the accounting period with that at the\nbeginning.\nLimitations of Single Entry System\nSingle Entry System provides the incompleteness and in sufficiency of information,\nhence it has the following limitations :\ni.Arithmetical Accuracy Cannot be Proved : Trial Balance can not be prepared\nand hence, arithmetical accuracy of books cannot be proved or tested. Chances\nof error, mischief of fraud remaining undetected are high.\nii.No Control on Assets : Since asset accounts are not maintained, it may be\ndifficult to keep full control, in order to avoid misappropriations of assets.\niii.    True Profits cannot be Known : Trading and Profit and Loss Account cannot\nbe prepared and hence, the correct profit earned or loss suffered during the\naccounting period is not known.\niv.    Financial Position of the Business cannot be Judged : Balance Sheet, called\nStatement of Affairs under Single Entry System, is prepared in an unsatisfactory\nmanner. The asets and liabilities are not provided from records but are put down\nby physical inspection and on estimated basis. Hence, Balance Sheet cannot be\ndrawn up with a view to ascertaining the true financial position of the business\non a particular date.

Then, the question arises as to how to ascertain profits when the\naccounting records are incomplete. The reason is that Profit and Loss Account cannot\nbe prepared in the absence of Trial Balance. In such a situation, there are two methods\nused for ascertaining profits of the business. They are :\ni.Net Worth Method or Statement of Affairs Method, and\nii.    Conversion Method\nNet Worth Method or Statement of Affairs Method\nTo ascertain profit, from incomplete records, it is necessary to prepare a Statement\nof Affairs at the end of the year and also at the beginning of the year, if not already\nprepared.\nA  Statement  of  Affairs  is  a  statement  of  all  assets  and  liabilities.  The\ndifference  between  the  amount  of  the  two  sides  is  taken  as  capital.\nLike the Balance Sheet, the Statement of Affairs has two sides - the right-hand side\nfor assets and the left-hand side for liabilities. To prepare the statment, information\nhas to be collected from various sources. Information about assets will be available\nfrom the Cash Book, the Personal Ledger, etc. The value of the Closing Stock will\nbe ascertained by preparing Stock Sheets and valuing the Stock in Hand, at lower\nof cost and market value. If the trader has any other assets also, like furniture,\nmachinery, etc., the value will be ascertained and included among the assets. The\nbusiness is likely to have full knowledge of the amounts owing to outsiders. The\ndifference between the total of assets and liabilities will be capital.\nCapital = Total Assets - Total Liabilities\nFor ascertaining profit the capital in the beginning of the year must also be ascertained,\nif necessary, by preparing a Statement of Affairs as at the beginning of the year. If\nthe capital at the end of the year exceeds that at the beginning, we can say that there\nhas been a profit. If, on the other hand, the capital in the beginning was more than\nthat at the end, there must have been a loss. However, two adjustments must be borne\nin mind for ascertaining profit :\ni.Adjustments  for  Capital  Introduced  :  If  the  proprietor  broght  in  some\nadditional capital during the year, it should be deducted from the capital at the\nend (since this increase is not due to profit but is due to fresh introduction of\ncapital); and\nAccounts From Incomplete Records"

The balance of profit (total\nprofit minus profit given to the guaranteed partner) is to be shared by the remaining\npartners in their respective profit -sharing ratio.\nWhen the new partner’s share of profit is more than the guaranteed amount, his actual\nshare of profit is given to him instead of the guaranteed amount of profit.\nIllustration 5 (Guarantee given by the firm to a partner)\nX and Y share profits & Losses in the ratio of 2 : 1 as from 1st April, 2013, they\nadmited Z as a partner who was to have one-tenth share of profit with a guaranteed\namount of `1,60,000.

In\nthat case it may need managerial help or additional capital. An option before the\npartnership firm is to admit partner/partners. When a partner is admitted to the existing\npartnership firm, it is called admission of a partner.\nAccording to the Partnership Act 1932, a person can be admitted\ninto partnership only with the consent of all the existing partners\nunless  otherwise  agreed  upon.\nOn admission of a new partner, the partnership firm is reconstituted with a new\nagreement. For example, Rekha and Nitesh are partners sharing profit in the ratio\nof 5:3. On April 1, 2014 they admitted Nitu as a new partner with 1/4th share in\nthe profit of the firm.

As a result, the profit sharing ratio in the new firm is decided mutually\nbetween the existing partners and the new partner. The incoming partner acquires his/\nher share of future profits either from one or more existing partner. The existing\npartners sacrifice a share of their profit in the favour of new partner, hence the\ncalculation of new profit sharing ratio becomes necessary.\nSacrificing Ratio\nAt the time of admission of a partner, existing partners have to surrender some of\ntheir share in favour of the new partner. The ratio in which they agree to sacrifice\ntheir share of profits in favour of incoming partner is called sacrificing ratio. Some\namount is paid to the existing partners for their sacrifice. The amount of compensation\nis paid by the new partner to the existing partners for acquiring the share of profit\nwhich they have surrendered in favour of the new partner.\nSacrificing Ratio is calculated as follows:\nSacrificing Ratio = Existing Ratio – New Ratio\nFollowing cases may arise for the calculation of new profit sharing ratio and sacrificing\nratio:\n(i)  Only  the  new  partner’s  share  is  given\nIn this case, it is presumed that the existing partners continue to share the remaining\nprofit in the same ratio in which they were sharing before the admission of the new\npartner.

This help the business earn some extra profits as compared to a newly\nset up business. In accounting, capitalised value of this extra profit is known as\ngoodwill. For example, your firm earns say `1200 and the normal rate of profit\nexpected to be earned by other similar firms in this industry is 10% say at this rate\nnormal profit of your firm is ` 700 goodwill is ascertained as under :\nStep  1  :Excess profit   =Actual profit – Desired normal profit\n    1200  –  700  =  500\nStep  2  :Goodwill=\n500\n100\n10\n×\n  =  `  5000\nIn other words, goodwill is the value of the reputation of a firm in respect of the profit\nearned in future over and above the normal profit. It may also be defined as the present\nvalue of the capacity to earn future profits. This means that a firm can be said to have\ngoodwill only if it has capacity to earn profit in future. A firm earning only normal\nprofits like similar firms cannot claim to have any goodwill.\nFactors affecting the Goodwill\nThe factors affecting goodwill are as follows:\n1.Location : If the firm is located at a central place, resulting in good sale, the\ngoodwill tends to be high.\n2.Nature of Business : A firm that produces high value products or having a\nstable demand is able to earn more profits and therefore has more goodwill.\n3.Efficient management : A well managed firm earns higher profit and so the\nvalue of goodwill will also be high.\n4.Quality : If a firm is known for the quality of its products the value of goodwill\nwill be high.\n5.Market Situation : The monopoly condition leads to earn high profits which\nleads to higher value of goodwill.\n6.Special Advantages : The firms which have special advantages like importing\nlicenses, long term contracts for supply of material, patents, trademarks, etc.\nenjoy higher value of goodwill.\nAdmission of a Partner"

The following are the important methods\nof valuing the goodwill of a firm :\n(i)Average Profit Method\n(ii)Super Profit Method\n(iii)Capitalisation Method\nLet us learn about these methods.\n1.Simple Average Profit Method : Under this method, average of the profits\nof certain given years is calculated. The value of the goodwill is calculated at\nan agreed number of years purchase of the average profit. Thus the goodwill\nis calculated as follows :\nValue of goodwill = Average Profit × Number of year of purchase\nFor example, the average profits of a firm of say 3 years is ` 25,000 and the\ngoodwill is to be calculated at 2 years purchase of the average profit. The value\nof the goodwill will be ` 50,000[` 25,000 × 2]. Thus  goodwill = average profits\n× Number of years purchase.\nIllustration : 4\nThe  profit  for  the  last  five  years  of  a  firm  were  as  follows  Year  2001\n` 1,20,000: Year 2002 ` 1,50,000: Year 2003 ` 1,70,000: Year 2004 ` 1,90,000:\nYear 2005 ` 2,00,000.

If a new business earns certain percentage of the capital employed, it is\ncalled ‘normal profit’. The value of the goodwill is calculated at an agreed number\nof years purchase of super profit by multiplying the Super Profit by the certain\nnumber of years. Normal profit is that profit which is, earned by other business\nunit of the same business. Normal profit will be calculated as follows:\nNormal profit=Capital employed × normal rate of return/100\nActual Profit:These are the profit earned during the year or it is also\ntaken as the average of the last few years profit.\nSuper Profit=Actual Profit – Normal Profit\nFor example, A firm earns profit of ` 65,000 on a capital of ` 4,80,000 and\nthe normal rate of return in similar business is 10%. Then the normal profit is\n` 48,000[10% of the ` 4,80,000]. The actual profit is ` 65,000. Thus,\nSuper profit=Actual profit – Normal profit\n=`  65,000  –  `  48,000\n=`  17,000\nIf value of Goodwill is calculated by 3 years’ purchase of super profit then\ngoodwill is equal to ` 51,000[ ` 17,000 × 3].\nWeighted average method : This method is a modified version of average profit\nmethod. In this method each year profit is assigned a weight i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4 etc.\nThereafter each year profit is multiplied by the weight and find product. The total of\nproducts is divided by the total of weight. As a result we find the weighted average\nprofit. After this the value of goodwill is calculated multiplying the weighted average\nprofit by the agreed number of year’s purchase. Thus the goodwill is calculated as\nfollows :\nWeighted average profit = \nTotal product of profit\nTotal of weights\nAdmission of a Partner"

This will\nresult in the reduction of the share of existing partners. Therefore, he/she compensates\nthe existing partners for the sacrifices. He/she compensates them by making payment\nin cash or in kind. The payment is equal to his/her share in the goodwill.\nAs per Accounting Standard 10(AS-10) that goodwill should be\nrecorded  in  the  books  only  when  some  consideration  in  money\nhas  been  paid  for  it.  Thus,  if  a  new  partner  does  not  bring\nnecessary cash for goodwill, no goodwill account can be raised\nin the books. He/she should pay for goodwill in addition to his/\nher  contribution  for  capital.\nIf, he/she does not pay for goodwill, then amount equal to his/her share of goodwill\nwill be deducted from the capital. The amount brought in by him/her as goodwill or\namount of goodwill deducted from his/her capital is divided between the existing\npartners in their sacrificing ratio. At the time of admission of a new partner any goodwill\nappearing in the books, will be written off in existing ratio among the existing partners.\nThere are different situations relating to treatment of goodwill at the time of admission\nof a new partner.

It is necessary to show the true\nposition of the firm at the time of admission of a new partner. If the values of the\nassets are raised, gain will increase the capital of the existing partners. Similarly, any\ndecrease in the value of assets, i.e. loss will decrease the capital of the existing\npartners. For this purpose a‘Revaluation Account’ is prepared. This account is\ncredited with all increases in the value of assets and decrease in the value of liabilities.\nIt is debited with decrease on account of value of assets and increase in the value\nof liabilities. The balance of this account shows a gain or loss on revaluation which\nis transferred to the existing partner’s capital account in existing profit sharing ratio.\nAccounting for Revaluation of Assets and Liabilities when there is a Change\nin  the  Profit  Sharing  Ratio  of  Existing  Partners\nAssets and liabilities of a firm must also be revalued at the time of change in profit\nsharing ratio of existing partners. The reason is that the realisable or actual value of\nassets and liabilities may be different from those shown in the Balance Sheet. It is\npossible that with the passage of time some of the assets might have appreciated in\nvalue while the value of certain other assets might have decreased and no record has\nbeen made of such changes in the books of accounts. Similarly there may be some\nunrecorded assets & libilities that may have to be accounted for. Revaluation of assets\nand reassessments of liabilities becomes necessary because the change in the value\nof assets and liabilities belongs to the period to change in profit sharing ratio and hence\nmust be shared by the partners in their old profit sharing ratio.\nRevaluation of assets and reassessment of liabilities may be given effect to in two\ndifferent ways :\nAdmission of a Partner"

An\nexample illustrating this point is given below:\nAnuj, Babu and Rani share profit in the ratio of 5 : 4 : 2.

For example, there is an old computer, which is\nstill in working condition though its book value is zero. Similarly, there may be some\nliabilities, which do not appear in the Balance Sheet, but actually they are still there.\nFor example, a bill discounted with bank, on dissolution it was dishonoured and had\nto be taken up by the firm for payment purposes.\nIt is to be kept in mind that an unrecorded asset would never be transferred  to the\ndebit of the Realisation Account, because the amount realised from its sale is in nature\nof a gain and the Realization Account is only credited accordingly. Similarly, an\nunrecorded liability need not be transferred to Realisation.\nReason being that its payment is a loss and Realisation Account is only debited with\nthe actual payment.

When company issues its shares\nat their face value, the shares are said to have been issued at par. Company can also\nissue its shares at more than or less than its face value i.e, at ‘Premium’ or at ‘Discount’\nrespectively. When shares are issued at premium or at discount an accounting\ntreatment different from shares issued at par is required. Let us discuss issue of shares\nat premium.\nIssue of Shares at Premium\nIf a company issues its shares at a price more than its face value, the shares are said\nto have been issued at Premium. The difference between the issue price and face\nvalue or nominal value is called ‘Premium’. If a share of ` 10 is issued at ` 12, it\nis said to have been issued at a premium of ` 2 per share. The money received as\npremium is transferred to Securities Premium A/c. A company issues its shares at\npremium only when its financial position is very sound. It is a capital gain to the\ncompany. The Premium money may be demanded by the company with application,\nallotment or with calls.\nThe Companies Act has laid down certain restrictions on the utilisation of the amount\nof premium.\nAccording to Section 78 of this Act, the amount of premium can be\nutilised for :\n(i)Issuing fully-paid bonus shares;\n(ii)    Writing off preliminary expenses, discount on issue of shares and\ndebentures, underwriting commission or expenses on issue;\n(iii)Paying  premium  on  redemplion  of  Preference  shares  or\nDebentures;\n(iv)   By Back of Shares.\nFurther, the company may demand the total amount of premium in more than one\ninstalment. In case the company doesn’t specify the particular call with which\nSecurities Premium is to be paid it is supposed to be called at the time of Allotment.\nAccounting Treatment of Premium on Issue of Shares\nFollowing is the accounting treatment of Premium on issue of shares :\nIssue of Shares"

These conditions are as follows :\n(i)At least one year must have elapsed from the date of commencement of business;\n(ii)Such shares are of the same class which has had already been issued;\n(iii)The company has sanctioned such issue by passing a resolution in its General\nmeeting and the approval of the court is obtained.\n(iv)Discount should not be more than 10% of the face value of the share and if the\ncompany wants to give discount more than 10%, it will have to obtain the sanction\nof the Central Government.\nAccounting Treatment of Shares Issued at Discount\nThe amount of discount is generally adjusted towards share allotment money and the\nfollowing journal entry is made:\nShare Allotment A/cDr.\nDiscount on issue of shares A/cDr.\nTo Share Capital A/c\n(Allotment money due on....shares @ ` ......per share\nafter allowing discount @ ` ..........per share)\nIssue of Shares"

You have also learnt that generally the issue price of shares is payable in\ninstalments i.e. on application, on allotment and on calls made from time to time by\nthe Board of Directors of the Company. Sometimes some shareholders fail to pay\nthe called up amount in full i.e., they do not pay on one or more instalments after\nthe allotment of the shares to them. In such a case either the company can go to the\ncourt and file a suit against the defaulting shareholders for recovery of the due amount\nor can cancel the membership of the defaulting shareholders. In case the membership\nis cancelled, the amount paid by the defaulting members towards share capital stands\nforfeited. It is called ‘Forfeiture of Shares.’\nIn this lesson you will learn about different situations in which shares can be forfeited\nand accounting treatment thereof.\nAfter  studying  this  lesson  you  will  be  able  to:\nzexplain the meaning of forfeiture of Shares:\nzexplain the situations in which shares can be forfeited;\nzexplain accounting treatment for forfeiture of shares issued at par, at discount\nand at premium and\nzprepare relevant accounts.\nOBJECTIVES"

With the cancellation, the defaulting shareholder\nalso loses the amount paid by him/her on such shares. Thus, when a shareholder is\ndeprived of his/her membership due to non payment of calls, it is known as forfeiture\nof shares. The result of forfeiture of shares is :\nCancellation of membership of the shareholder.\nReduction of issued share Capital of the company.\nLet us take an example to make it more clear. S.K. Ltd. issued 100000 shares of\n` 10 each payable as ` 2 on application, ` 2 on allotment, ` 3 on first call and\n` 3 on second and final call. Mr. Harish, the allottee of 100 shares, fails to pay the\nsecond and final call money made by the company. In this case if the Board of\nDirectors decide to forfeit his shares, his membership will be cancelled and the amount\nof ` 700 paid by him (on 100 shares ` 2 on application, ` 2 on allotment and\n` 3 on first call per share) will be forfeited. Now Mr. Harish will no longer be the\nmember of the company and the issued capital of the company will be reduced by\n`  1000.\nProcedure of forfeiture of shares\nThe authority to forfeit shares is given to the Board of Directors in Articles of\nAssociation of the company. The Board of Directors has to give at least fourteen days\nnotice to the defaulting members calling upon them to pay outstanding amount with\nor without interest as the case may be before the specified date. The notice must\nalso state that if the shareholders fail to remit the amount mentioned therein within\nthe stipulated period, their shares will be forfeited. If they still fail to pay the amount\nwithin the specified period of time, the Board of Directors of the company may decide\nto forfeit such shares by passing a resolution. The decision regarding the forfeiture\nof shares should be communicated to the concerned allottees and should be asked\nto return the allotment letters and share certificates of the forfeited shares to the\ncompany.\nForfeiture of Shares"

You have also\nlearnt that if a shareholder fails to pay the allotment and/or call money, the company\nmay forfeit such shares. If shares are forfeited the membership of the shareholder\nstands cancelled and the shares become the property of the company. Thereafter,\nthe company has an option of selling such forfeited shares. The sale of forfeited shares\nis called ‘reissue of shares’.\nIn this lesson you will learn the meaning of ‘reissue of shares’ and its accounting\ntreatment in the books of the company.\nAfter  studying  this  lesson  you  will  be  able  to:\nzstate the meaning of reissue of shares;\nzstate the minimum price at which a company can reissue its forfeited shares and\nzgive accounting treatment of reissue of shares in different situations.\n  29.1  REISSUE  OF  SHARES  :  MEANING  AND  ISSUE  PRICE\nShares are forfeited because only a part of  the due amount of such shares is received\nand the balance remains unpaid. On forfeiture the membership of the original allottee\nis cancelled. He/she cannot be asked to make payment of the remaining amount. Such\nshares become the property of the company. Therefore company may sell these\nshares. Such sale of shares is called ‘reissue of shares’. Thus reissue of shares means\nissue of forfeited shares.\nOBJECTIVES"

The board of\ndirectors passes a resolution allotting the forfeited shares to the new purchaser/\npurchasers of such shares.\nIn case of reissue of shares neither a prospectus is issued nor any offer is  otherwise\nmade to the general public. Though the amount of such shares may be called in more\nthan one instalment but usually the entire amount is called in one instalment i.e.\nlumpsum.\nThe board of directors of the company while reissuing the shares decide the price\nof reissue. These shares can be reissued at par, at premium or at discount. Generally,\nthese shares are reissued at a discount i.e. at a price which is less than its nominal\nvalue. The amount of discount allowed at the time of reissue in no case should be\nmore than the amount forfeited on such shares.\nQuestion arises at what price the forfeited shares can be reissued? There is no limit\nof the price at which it can be reissued if price charged is more than the price of\nissue at the time of their forfeiture. But then there is a limit below which price cannot\nbe charged or we can say that there is a minimum price below which the company\ncannot reissue its forfeited shares. We can look at it from another angle i.e. the\ncompany cannot give discount more than a particular amount while reissuing the\nforfeited shares.\nThe maximum permissible discount at the time of reissue of forfeited shares is\nascertained in different situations in the following manner:\n(i)    Shares Originally Issued at Par : When the shares are originally issued at\npar, the maximum permissible discount for reissue of shares is equal to the amount\nforfeited on such shares\n(ii)Shares Originally Issued at Premium : In case of shares originally issued at\npremium, there can be two situations : (a) premium has not been received on\nthe forfeited shares, and (b) premium has been received on such shares. The\namount forfeited is the amount that has been received including the amount of\npremium if it has been received and the maximum discount that can be allowed\non reissue of such shares is the amount so forfeited.\n(iii)Shares Originally Issued at Discount : In this case  the actual amount received\nbecomes the forfeited amount. But the maximum permissible discount on reissue of\nshares will be equal to the amount forfeited plus the amount of discount initially allowed\non these shares at the time of their original issue.\nReissue of Forfeiture Shares"

Such capital is raised by issuing shares. Those who hold the shares of the\ncompany are called the shareholders and are owners of the company. Company may\nneed additional amount of money for a long period. It cannot issue shares every time.\nIt can raise loan from the public. The amount of loan can be divided into units of\nsmall denominations and  the company can offer the same for subscription to the\npublic. Each unit is called a ‘debenture’ and holder of such units is called Debenture\nholder. The amount so raised is loan for the company. In this lesson we shall learn\nabout issue of debentures and its accounting treatment.\nAfter  studying  this  lesson  you  will  be  able  to  :\nzstate the meaning and types of debentures;\nzexplain the procedure of issue of debentures and its accounting treatment;\nzexplain issue of debentures as collateral security;\nzexplain ‘writing off 'discount' and 'loss' on issue debentures and their accounting\ntreatment in the books of the company and\nzcalculate interest on debentures.\nOBJECTIVES"

When a company intends to raise the loan\namount from the public it issues debentures. A person holding debenture or debentures\nis called a debenture holder. A debenture is a document issued under the seal of the\ncompany. It is an acknowledgment of the loan received by the company equal to the\nnominal value of the debenture. It bears the date of redemption and rate and mode\nof payment of interest. A debenture holder is the creditor of the company.\nAs per section 2(12) of Companies Act 1956, “Debenture includes debenture stock,\nbond and any other securities of the company whether constituting a charge on the\ncompany’s assets or not”.\nTypes  of  Debentures\nDebenture can be classified as under :\n1. From Security Point of View\n(i)Secured or Mortgage Debentures : These are the debentures that are secured\nby a charge on the assets of the company. These are also called mortgage\ndebentures. The holders of secured debentures have the right to recover their\nprincipal amount with the unpaid amount of interest on such debentures out of\nthe assets mortgaged by the company. In India, debentures must be secured.\nSecured debentures can be of two types :\nTypes of Debentures\nOn the Basis of\nSecurity\nSecond\nDebentures\nRedemptionRecordsConvertibilityPriority\nSecured/Mortgage  UnsecuredRedeemableNon-redeemable\nFirst\nMortgage\nSecond\nMortgage\nRegistered\nBearer\nConvertibleNon-convertible\nFirst\nDebentures\nIssue of Debentures"

Such debentures do not have any charge\non the assets of the company.\n2.  On  the  Basis  of  Redemption\n(i)Redeemable Debentures : These are the debentures which are issued for a\nfixed period. The principal amount of such debentures is paid off to the debenture\nholders on the expiry of such period. These can be redeemed by annual drawings\nor by purchasing from the open market.\n(ii)Non-redeemable  Debentures  : These  are  the  debentures  which  are  not\nredeemed in the life time of the company. Such debentures are paid back only\nwhen the company goes into liquidation.\n3.  On  the  Basis  of  Records\n(i)Registered Debentures : These are the debentures that are registered with\nthe company. The amount of such debentures is payable only to those debenture\nholders whose name appears in the register of the company.\n(ii)Bearer Debentures : These are the debentures which are not recorded in a\nregister of the company.

The  term  and\nconditions  of  conversion  are  generally  announced  at  the  time  of  issue  of\ndebentures.\n(ii)Non-convertible Debentures : The debenture holders of such debentures\ncannot convert their debentures into shares of the company.\n5.

Education is an instrument of change. The right type\nof education at right time can bring about positivity in the outlook of society, attitudinal\nchanges to face the new/fresh challenges and the courage to face difficult situations.\nThis can be very effectively achieved by regular periodic curriculum renewal. A static\ncurriculum does not serve any purpose, as it does not cater to the current needs and\naspirations of the individual and society.\nFor this purpose only, educationists from all over the country come together at regular\nintervals to deliberate on the issues of changes needed and required. As an outcome of\nsuch deliberations, the National Curriculum Framework (NCF 2005) came out, which\nspells out in detail the type of education desirable/needed at various levels of education\n- primary, elementary, secondary or senior secondary.\nKeeping this framework and other national and societal concerns in mind, we have\ncurrently revised the curriculum of Economics course at Senior Secondary level, as\nper  the  Common  Core  Curriculum  provided  by  National  Council  of  Educational\nResearch and Training (NCERT) and the Council of Boards of School Education in\nIndia (COBSE) making it current and need based. Textual material production is an\nintegral and essential part of all NIOS programmes offered through open and distance\nlearning system. Therefore, we have taken special care to make the learning material\nuser friendly, interesting and attractive for you.\nI  would  like  to  thank  all  the  eminent  persons  involved  in  making  this  material\ninteresting and relevant to your needs.

The list is unending. From the point of view of better\nunderstanding of the subject and finding a solution to the problem, it is imperative\nto know the nature of the economic issue under study and the area or branch under\nwhich the issue is dealt with.\nOBJECTIVES\nAfter completing this lesson, you will be able to:\nzunderstand the meaning of economics;\nzdistinguish between positive and normative economics;\nzdifferentiate  between  micro  and  macroeconomics  and  highlight  their\ncomponents;\nzexamine the significance of microeconomics and macroeconomics; and\nzrelate the interdependence of microeconomics and macroeconomics.\n12.1  MEANING OF ECONOMICS\nThe term ‘Economics’ is derived from two Greek words OIKOS and NEMEIN,\nmeaning the rule or law of the household. Economics therefore is concerned with\nnot just how a nation allocates its resources to various uses but it ideals with the\nprocess  by  which  the  productive  capacity  of  these  resources  can  be  further"

British  economist  Robbins  has  defined\neconomics as follows:\n“Economics  is  the  science  which  studies  human  behaviour  as  a  relationship\nbetween ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.\nRobbins definition is comprehensive in explaining the scope of Economics. It is\nthe problem of ‘choice’ which is all pervasive in areas of consumption, production\nand exchange. For example, a consumer has to choose that combination of goods\nwhich yields maximum satisfaction. Similarly, a firm has to choose that size of\noutput which ensures maximum profit. Nobel Laureate Prof. Samuelson has\nspelled out Economics as follows:\n“Economics is the study of how men and society choose, with or without the use\nof money, to employ scarce productive resources which could have alternative\nuses, to produce various commodities over time, and distribute them for consumption\nnow and in the future among various people and groups of society”.\n12.2  POSITIVE VS NORMATIVE ECONOMICS\nWhile discussing the issues related to the economic conditions and trying to find\nsolutions  to  economic  problems,  economists  often  talk  about  positive  and\nnormative nature of these issues. Positive economics deals with economic analysis\nwhich are based on facts and statistical data. When an economic phenomenon is\nbeing described with statistical support, then we call it positive economics. So\npositive economics relates to the phenomenon of ‘what is’. On the other hand,\nnormative  economics  deals  with  the  issue  of  ‘what  ought  to  be’.  Normative\neconomics is based on value judgement and debate which are required to arrive at\nsome conclusion. Issues related to framing policies for the society, mostly come\nunder normative economics. Take the example of the issue of India’s population.\nIt is the fact that as per 2011 census, India’s population was around 121 crore.\nSince it is based on data, the statement relates to positive economics. But when we\ndiscuss  about  the  problems  faced  due  to  population  pressure,  economists  and\npolicy  makers  recommend  several  solutions  such  as  ‘India  should  control  its\npopulation by adopting family planning’ etc. such a thing comes under normative\neconomics because these can be debate on this policy. There are lot of economic\nproblems faced by the citizens and the economy as a whole. Data are required to\njustify that a problem exists which is part of positive economics. When we try to\nfind solutions to the problem then value judgements are made and debates take\nplace which comes under normative economics."

So, when the study or the problem relates to an individual unit\nor part of the economy then the subject of study is micro economics. Macro means\nlarge. When the study relates to the whole economy or to aggregates relating to\nthe whole economy then the subject of study is macro economics.\nMicroeconomics\nMicroeconomics is the study of economic activity of an economic unit or a part\nof the economy or a small group of more than one unit. Derived from the Greek\nword micros meaning small, it relates to the individual economic agent’s behaviour\nand the result of such interactions in determining the price of goods and services.It\nis, thus, also called Price Theory.\nIt is the microscopic study of the economy which deals with decision making by\nany individual, firm,household with respect to matters of production, consumption,\ndetermination of prices in the market,determination of wage rate, and so on. The\naim  is  to  provide  a  framework  within  which  the  behaviour  patterns  and\ninterrelationships between individual economic units can be studied and their\nbehaviour with regards to production, exchange and distribution of goods and\nservices can be predicted. Thus, attainment of a state of equilibrium from the point\nof view of individual economic units is the main aim in microeconomic analysis.\nFurther, micro economics also puts emphasis on behaviour patterns and role of\nfirms and individuals in income distribution and study of conditions of efficiency\nin production and attainment of overall efficiency. Efficiency implies optimum\nallocation of resources among the consumers and producers so that there is neither\nexcess demand nor excess supply of goods and services. The analysis of the three\ncentral problems of an economy- what goods and services to be produced, how\nto produce them and how they can be distributed in the economy are all subject\nmatter of micro economics."

The word macro is derived from the Greek\nword macros meaning  large.  It  has  emerged  after  the  British  economist  John\nMaynard Keynes published his famous book The General Theory of Employment,\nInterest and Money in 1936. The Great Depression of 1929 made economists think\nabout the subject in a newer way which was holistic and macroeconomic study\ndeveloped. It is also called the Theory of Income and Employment.\nThe content of macroeconomic analysis involves a combination of units to get a\ncomplete picture of the economic system so as to deal with economic affairs at a\nlarge scale. The focus areas are aggregate economic variables of an economy. The\ncomponents  of  output,  price  level  and  employment  operate  in  an  economy\nsimultaneously which indicates that they bear a close relationship with each other.\nThis forms the basis of macroeconomic study which attempts to analyse these\nattributes together. It sees the economy as a combination of four components-\nhouseholds, firms, government and external sector.\nThe study area involves the analysis of effects in the market of taxation, budgetary\npolicies, policies on money supply, role of state, rate of interest, wages, employment,\nand output. It is, therefore, also called income theory as it is concerned with the\neconomy as a whole and seeks to study the causes and solutions for economic\nissues such as unemployment, inflation, balance of payment deficits and so on.\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 12.3\n1.

In other words, they are interrelated. A close interlink\nexists between macro and micro economics. All micro economic studies can help\nin better understanding and analysis of the macro economic variables. Such studies\nalso help in the formulation of economic policies and programmes. As you know\nthat the changes and processes in an economy are a result of a variety of large and\nsmall scale elements which have a capacity to affect each other and are also affected\nby each other. For example, increased taxes are a macroeconomic decision but\ntheir impact on savings of a firm is microeconomic analysis. Further, how this\nsaving impacts the economy is a macroeconomic analysis.\nTake another example. If we know how the price of a commodity is determined\nand understand the role of buyers and sellers in the process of price determination,\nit would help us in analysing the changes that take place in the general price level\nfor all the commodities as a whole in the economy. A study of the process of price\ndetermination and the role of buyers and sellers in this process is a micro economic\nstudy, whereas the study of the general price level in the economy is a macro\neconomic study. Similarly, if we want to assess the performance of an economy,\nwe will have to find out the performance of each sector of the economy and to find\nout the performance of each sector we will have to find out the performance of each\nproduction unit individually or in groups. A study of each group of production unit\nor of each sector is a micro economic study whereas the study of all the production\nunits or all the sectors taken together is a macro economic study. Thus, micro\neconomics and macro economics are two interrelated parts of economics.\nTherefore, the study of both is indispensable in economic study.\n12.5  DIFFERENCES  BETWEEN  MICRO  AND  MACRO\nECONOMICS\nSignificant differences exist between the two branches in the following ways:\n(i) Differences in the scale of study\nMacroeconomics is related to the study of the aggregate while microeconomics\nrelates to the individual economic agents\n(ii) Differences in the field of study\nMacroeconomic analysis is concerned with the broadest level of policies pertaining\nto  income,  employment  and  growth  of  resources  while  microeconomics  is"

For\nexample, a person needs food, water, clothing and shelter in order to survive.\nThese are the basic needs of a person. However, no person would like to satisfy\nonly his/her basic needs if he/she could improve his/her life. People, by nature, want\nmore than what they just need for survival. If one want is satisfied, many others\ncrop up and this goes on endlessly.\nLet us understand this through an example. Suppose Neha wants some food, a\nblouse, utensil for her mother,  sweets for her brother, and bangles. These may be\nonly a few of the many things that Neha may like to have if she had some money.\nThis example shows that an individual’s wants are unlimited.\n(b)  Limited  Resources\nLet us say that all the things said above are available at some price. Now suppose\nthat Neha has only ` 1000 with her to spend. Let food is available at ` 150, a blouse\ncosts ` 200, value of utensil is ` 600, a packet of sweet costs ` 200 and a set of\nbangles is available at ` 50. All these taken together would cost Neha ` 1200. Since\nshe has only ` 1000 with her, Neha has to adjust her purchases accordingly. Here,\nwe say that the means to satisfy Neha’s wants are limited to ` 1000. People may\nhave high or low income but not unlimited income. Hence, resources (or income)\navailable to consumers are scarce or limited.\nResources  also  include  factors  of  production:  land,  labour,  capital  and\nentrepreneurship. These resources are not available in abundance in this world.\nThey are scarce or limited. Scarcity means that the demand for the resources is\ngreater than their availability.\n(c)  Alternative  Uses  of  Resources\nThe above example also highlights another important fact that a resource can be\nused in different ways. In Neha’s case, she can use her ` 1000 to buy some items.\nOnce she chooses to buy something (for example utensil for her mother) then she\ncan not satisfy her other wants. Similarly, all factors of production can be put to\nalternative uses. For example, a piece of land can be used to do farming, build a\nfactory, develop a school or build a hospital. A labour can be used to plough a field,\nto make baskets or to sell vegetables. Hence, we see that resources have alternative\nuses."

We have also discussed that resources have alternative\nuses. This basic problem exists in every economy - whether rich or poor; developed\nor developing.\nScarcity of resources also leads to choice. In our example, Neha has only ` 1000\nto spend but she wants to buy many things which was limited. So she must choose\nwhat she wants. In this way a consumer tries to solve the economic problem of\nunlimited wants and limited resources. Similarly producers also face the economic\nproblem as they need to decide as to which alternative use should they put their\nscarce resources.\nSuppose resources were not limited. Would it still lead to the economic problem?\nThe answer to this question is that if resources were not scarce they could be used\nto satisfy all wants. Hence, the basic problem of scarcity and choice would not\narise. Scarcity of resources results in people making decisions about how best they\nwould like to use these limited resources. Making the best use of resources is\ntermed as economizing of resources. Economizing of resources does not mean\nbeing  miserly  about  using  resources,  but  using  resources  judiciously  so  that\nmaximum benefit can be obtained from the scarce resources.\nINTEXT  QUESTIONS  13.1\nState whether the following statements are true or false:\n1.Resources are scarce.\n2.Wants are limited.\n3.Scarcity does not lead to choice.\n4.Resources have alternative uses.\n5.Every economy does not face the basic economic problem.\n6.Economizing of resources means being miserly about using resources.\n7.Land is a factor of production.\n8.Human wants are unlimited.\n9.Resources are scarce if demand is less than its availability.\n10.

This economic problem gives\nrise to people making choices about how they would like to use scarce resources.\nThis economic problem gives rise to the central problems of an economy which are\nas following\nzWhat to produce and in what quantities?\nzHow to produce?\nzFor whom to produce?\nThese are called central problems because every economy has to face them and\nseek solutions to them.\nCollectively,  these  central  problems  are  called  the  Problem  of  Allocation  of\nResources.\nLet us discuss each of these central problems in detail\n(a)  What  to  produce  and  in  what  quantities?\nThe fact that resources are scarce leads to the problem of ‘what to produce’ and\nin what quantities to produce. An individual producer needs to decide on how to\nemploy the sources that are available to her for production. For example, if Lata,\na farmer has a piece of land, she needs to think about what crop she would like to\nproduce on her land. Let us assume taht she can grow either sugarcane or wheat.\nGiven that her land is limited, she needs to choose whether she wants to use the\nland to produce sugarcane or wheat or both. Once Lata has taken this decision she\nneeds to think about the quantity of the crop that she would like to produce. For\nexample, 10 quintals, 20 quintals or 50 quintals.\nThis problem of ‘what to produce’ and in what quantities to produce is faced by\nall economies. An economy needs to choose whether it wants to use its resources\nto  produce  consumer  goods  or  producer  goods.  Alternatively,  to  what  extent\nshould luxury goods be produced in comparison to necessities or goods of mass\nconsumption? An economy may also be faced with the question of how much of\ncivilian goods to be produced and how much of defence goods to be produced. In\nother words, scarce resources require economies to decide the combination of\ngoods and services they should produce.\nThe problem of what to produce and in what quantities to be produced can be\nsolved by a government that decides the allocation of resources in different areas\nof production. Alternatively, it can be solved based on the preferences of people\nin an economy and on the price of goods and services in market."

A technique of production could be either labour intensive or capital\nintensive. In  a  production  process  when  more  units  of  labour  are  used  in\nproportion to capital, it is termed as a labour intensive technique. Alternatively,\nwhen the proportion of capital used is more than labour, the production process\nis called a capital intensive technique.\nLet us understand this with the help of some examples. On Lata’s farm, she has the\nchoice of using different combinations of labour and capital to produce her crop.\nIf she chooses to do the ploughing, sowing, harvesting and threshing with her\nbullocks and employing people, then she is using a labour intensive technique. On\nthe other hand, if she uses machines such as tractor, harvester and thresher to do\nthe  same  work,  then  she  is  using  a  capital  intensive  technique  of  production.\nSimilarly, in cloth production the use of handlooms is a labour intensive technique\nto produce cloth whereas the use of powerlooms is a capital intensive technique\nof production of cloth.\nThe solution of the problem of how to produce is based on the extent of output that\nis produced for a given level of resources. Any producer would like to maximize\nthe level of output from the available resources. At the same time cost of using a\ntechnique is equally very important. A producer will use that particular technology\nwhich is available at least cost.\n(c)  For  whom  to  produce?\nThe problem of ‘for whom to produce’  relates to how the value of the produced\noutput of an economy gets distributed amongst different people. People do not\nreceive the output they produce as their compensation. The output is sold and the\nmoney is earned in the production process. This money is paid as income to people\nfor the work they have done in the production process. This income, in turn, is used\nby people to satisfy their wants. Hence, the problem of for whom to produce tells\nus how the different factors of production are compensated for their work.\nIn our example, once Lata’s crop is harvested and sold,\n \nshe needs to pay the various\nfactors of production for their services. The labour will be paid wages, land will\nbe paid rent, capital (in the form of machinery) will be paid interest. Lastly, Lata\nwill earn profit as an entrepreneur for organising the factors of production and\nundertaking some risk of running the produciton activity."

They must also be used judiciously\nto  give  the  maximum  output.  Thus,  optimum  utilization  of  resources  has  the\nfollowing implications:\n(i)    All resources must be utilized and\n(ii)Resources must be used efficiently\nThese two issues are discussed below:\n(i) All resources must be utilized\nIf resources are not utilized/employed or are lying idle, it means that they are being\nwasted. Wastage of resources results in low output. For example, people may be\nunemployed. This means that human resources are being wasted. Similarly, when\nworkers in a factory go on strike, capital resources lie idle and are wasted. If these\nresources are utilized, the output that can be produced in the economy shall rise.\nThus, every economy must ensure that scarce resources are utilized and not left\nidle or unemployed.\n(ii) Efficient Utilization of resources\nSince resources are scarce, they should not be under utilized. Under utilization of\nresources means that resources are not being used to their fullest capacity. For\nexample, if a person finds a job in which he works only for 4 hours a day, but his\ncapacity to work is 8 hours a day, then his labour is under utilized. In other words,\nthe person is not being employed efficiently. If he had a job for 8 hours a day, the\noutput would increase. Under utilization of resources also results in wastage of\nresources. Hence, every economy must try and adopt techniques of production\nthat ensure efficient utilization of resources.\n(b)  Growth  of  resources\nWe have studied earlier in the chapter that wants are unlimited. This means that\npeople continuously want more and more goods. However, these ever increasing\nwants can not be satisfied unless the resources that produce goods and services are\nincreased. Thus, resources must grow to satisfy the constantly increasing wants in\nan economy. So, how can resources grow in an economy? Resources can increase\nif:"

For example, when the population\nincreases, then the quantity of human resource increases. Similarly, when more\nnatural  resources  are  found,  it  increases  the  availability  of  resources  in  an\neconomy.\n(ii) There are qualitative changes in resources\nQualitative  changes  in  human  capital  occur  due  to  better  training  and  skill\ndevelopment. Qualitative changes in man made capital occur when there is an\nimprovement in technology. Under qualitative changes, the amount of resources\navailable does not change but their productivity increases. Productivity is defined\nas the output per unit of input. For example, if labour gets trained, then the output\nfrom the same person can increase. Productivity improves due to better skill and\ntraining.\nTo  conclude  our  discussion,  growth  of  resources  occurs  when  the  physical\navailability of resources increases and/or there is technological upgradation or an\nimprovement in the quality of resources.\nINTEXT  QUESTIONS  13.3\nChoose the correct answer:\n1.

If more and more resources are being diverted towards the\nproduction of bicycles, little amount will be left for the production of rice. Similarly\nif all the resources are being used in the production of bicycles, say 150 bicycles\ncan be produced and no resources will be left for the production of rice. Therefore,\nthe  scarce  resources  are  employed  in  various  combinations  to  get  alternative\nproduction possibilities.\nThe production possibilities curve is a graphical medium of highlighting the central\nproblem of ‘what to produce’. To decide what to produce and in what quantities,\nit is first necessary to know what is obtainable. The curve shows the options that\nare obtainable, or simply the production possibilities. What is obtainable is based\non the following assumptions:\nzThe resources available are fixed.\nzThe technology remains unchanged.\nzThe resources are fully employed.\nzThe resources are efficiently employed.\nThe resources are not equally efficient in production of all products. Thus, if\nresources  are  transferred  from  production  of  one  good  to  another,  the  cost  of\nproduction may increase.\n13.5  PRODUCTION  POSSIBILITY  SCHEDULE\nTo simplify, let us assume that only two goods are produced in an economy. Let\nthese two goods be guns and butter. The example given by a famous economist\nSamuelson who won nobel prize in economics in the year 1969. The example,\nsymbolizes the problem of choice between war goods and civilian goods. Given\nthe extremes and the in-between possibilities, a schedule can be prepared. It can\nbe called a production possibilities schedule. A Production Possibilities Schedule\n(or Table) is a set of numbers in tabular form that illustrates different possible\ncombinations of two goods that can be produced if all available resources are\nefficiently used during a given time given technology of production. Suppose if all\nthe resources are engaged in the production of guns, there will be a maximum\namount of guns that can be produced per year. Let it be 15 units. At the other\nextreme suppose all the resources are employed in production of butter only. Let\nthe maximum amount of butter that can be produced is 5 units. These are the two\nextreme possibilities. In between the resources can also be partly used for the\nproduction of guns and partly for production of butter. Given the extremes and the\nin-between possibilities, a schedule can be prepared. It can be called a production\npossibility schedule (PPS). Let the schedule be given as follows."

PPS shows alternative production possibilities of two sets of goods with\nthe given resources and techniques of production. PPC is a graphic representation\nof PPS. It is also called Production Possibility Frontier (PPF).

When some resources are transferred\nto increase production of butter from 0 to 1 unit, then production of gun fall from\n15 to 14 so that the economy reaches at point B on PPC and so on.

So  PPC  is  a  graphical  representation  of  the\nalternative combinations of the amounts of two goods or services that an economy\ncan produce by transferring resources from one good or service to the other. This\ncurve helps in determining what quantity of a nonessential good or a service an\neconomy can afford to produce without jeopardizing the required production of\nan essential good or service. PPC has two following properties:\n(a)   PPC slopes downward: This means that more of a good can be produced only\nby sacrificing some quantity of the other good.\n(b)   PPC is concave to the point of origin: You can see that some amount of gun\nhas  to  be  reduced  to  produce  one  unit  extra  of  butter.  This  is  done  by\ntransferring resources from the produciton of gun to that of butter. The rate\nat which the units of a good is reduced to increase a unit of another good is\ncalled marginal rate of transformation (MRT). MRT is measured along PPC\nwhen the economy moves from one point to another. In Fig. 13.1, movement\nfrom point A to B to C and so on gives the idea of MRT. When the economy\nmoves from point A to B, 1 unit of gun is reduced (from 15 units to 14 units)\nto produce extra unit of butter (from 0 to 1 unit). When the economy moves\nfrom point B to C, 2 units gun are given up (from 14 to 12 units) to produce\nanother unit of butter (from 1 to 2 units). This way some units are guns are\nreduced to gain one unit of butter. So MRT measures the change in one good\n(here gun), due to change in another good (here butter).\nHence MRT  measures the rate of change of PPC or simply the slope of PPC.\nOn a concave shaped PPC as in Fig. 13.1, we see that when we increase butter\nby one unit, we have to decrease gun by more units than before. So on a\nconcave PPC, MRT increases.\nHere MRT = \nChange in Guns\nOne unit change in Butter\nThe curve is based on the following assumptions:\n(a)   quantity of factors of production is fixed\n(b)   full employment\n(c)   technology is given\n(d)   There are two goods produced in the economy.\nPPC can be a straight line if production is obtained under law of constant returns\nor when marginal rate of transformation of both the commodities is same. For e.g.\nto produce one more unit of commodity X if only one unit of commodity Y is\nsacrificed through out then PPC becomes a straight line. However, this is only a\nconceptual possibility. The significance of this curve lies in the interpretation of the\ncentral  problems  and  help  in  finding  solutions  to  them.  This  is  done  through"

If, however, the economy functions at a\npoint inside the production possibility curve, then it shows that there exists either\nunderutilization or inefficient utilization of resources.\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n5\n9\n12\nGuns\nButter\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nFig 13.2 : Underutilisation or inefficient utilization of resources\nRefer to our schedule of PPL given earlier.\nLet us understand this point with the help of a diagram given in Fig. 13.2. In Fig.\n13.2, we see that at point G, the economy is producing 2 units of butter and 5 units\nof guns. Through a re-allocation of resources, the economy can do one of the\nfollowing:\n(a)   increase the production of guns to 12 units and keep the production of butter\nat the same 2 units as at point C on PPC."

Growth of resources occurs when the physical\nquantum of resources increases or when there is a rise in the productivity level of\nresources. This implies that with growth in resources, the output produced in an\neconomy will increase.

At point U, the economy produces only guns\nwhich has increased to 20 units. This is more than the output of gun at point A.\nSimilarly, at point Z, when the production of gun is zero, the output of butter is 20\nunits. This is greater than the output of 5 units when resources had not grown.

Using up of goods and\nservices to satisfy wants is called consumption and the economic agent who buys\ngoods and services is called a consumer. When a consumer buys any good or\nservice, his/her main objective is to get maximum satisfaction from the quantity of\nthe commodities purchased by spending his/her income at the given market price.\nHow does a consumer maximize his/her satisfaction from spending his/her income\non various goods and services is the subject matter of this chapter.\nOBJECTIVES\nAfter completing this lesson, you will be able to:\nzunderstand the meaning of consumer’s equilibrium;\nzunderstand the meaning of utility, marginal utility and total utility;\nzunderstand the relationship between total utility and marginal utility;\nzexplain the law of diminishing marginal utility;\nzexplain consumer’s equilibrium, based on utility analysis;\nzunderstand the meaning of indifference curve, indifference map, budget line,\nbudget set and marginal rate of substitution; and\nzderive consumer’s equilibrium using indifference curve and budget line.\n14.1  MEANING OF CONSUMER’S EQUILIBRIUM\nEquilibrium means a state of rest from where there is no tendency to change.

They are as\nfollows:\n1.   Cardinal utility approach (or Marshall’s utility analysis)\n2.   Ordinal utility approach (or indifference curve analysis)\n14.2  CARDINAL UTILITY APPROACH\nThe theory of consumers behaviour by using utility approach was first given by the\nnoted economist Alfred Marshall.\nBefore discussing how a consumer attains equilibrium , we need to understand the\nconcept of utility, marginal utility and total utility.\n(i)  Utility\nUtility is defined as the power of a commodity to satisfy a human want. Utility\nof a commodity is the total amount of psychological satisfaction that a person gets\nfrom consumption of a good or service, e.g. a thirsty person derives satisfaction\nfrom drinking a glass of water. So a glass of water has got utility for the thirsty\nperson. Utility differs from person to person. Utility is subjective and cannot be\nmeasured quantitatively. Yet for the sake of  convenience it is measured in ‘utils’.\nMarshall  suggested  that  the  measurement  of  utility  should  also  be  done  in\nmonetary terms by converting ‘util’ into money by using the following formula\nUtility in Money = Utility in Util/Utility of a rupee. Utility of rupee can be assumed\nto be any number such as 1, 2, 3 ... . Let utility of a rupee is assumed to be 2 utils.\nThen 10 utils = \n10\n2\n = ` 5.\n(ii) Marginal Utility (MU)\nMarginal utility is the addition to the total utility derived from the consumption\nof an additional unit of a commodity. It can also be defined as the utility from\nthe last unit of a commodity consumed. Let us explain the concept of marginal\nutility with the help of an example. Suppose, a consumer gets total utility of 10 utils\nfrom consumption of one orange and 18 utils from two oranges. He gets 8 utils\nfrom consumption of second orange. So, marginal utility of second orange is 8\nutils. If total utility derived from three oranges is 24 utils then marginal utility of"

In this case third orange is the last orange.\nThus marginal utility of 3 oranges is 6 utils. Marginal utility can be calculated by\nthe following formula:\nMU\nn \n= TU\nn \n– TU\nn–1\nor\nǻTU\nMU =\nǻX\nWhereMU\nn\n= Marginal utility of nth unit of the commodity\nTU\nn\n= Total utility of n units\nTU\nn–1\n= Total utility of n–1 units\nX\nn\n= Quantity of nth unit of good X\nX\nn–1\n= Quantity or (n–1)th unit of good X\n“n” takes the values 1, 2, 3, ... .\n(iii) Total utility\nTotal utility is the total satisfaction obtained from the consumption of all\npossible  units  of  a  commodity. For  example,  if  the  first  orange  gives  you  a\nsatisfaction of 10 utils, second one gives you 8 utils and third one gives you 6 utils,\nthen total utility from three oranges = 10 + 8 + 6 = 24 utils. Total utility can be\nobtained by summing up marginal utilities from consumption of different units of\na commodity. Thus, total utility can be calculated as:\nTU\nn\n = MU\n1 \n+ MU\nZ \n+ MU\n3 \n+ ........

The\nlaw of diminishing marginal utility also explains the same thing. It states that ‘as\nmore and more units of a commodity are consumed, marginal utility derived\nfrom each successive unit goes on diminishing.’\nThe law can be explained with the help of an example. Suppose, a thirsty man\ndrinks water. The first glass of water he drinks will give him maximum satisfaction\n(utility), say, 20 utils. Second glass of water will also fetch him utility but not as\nmuch as the first one because a part of his thirst is satisfied by drinking the first glass\nof water. Suppose he gets 10 utils from the second glass. It is just possible that he\nmay get zero utility from the third glass because his thirst has now been satisfied.\nThere will be negative utility from the fourth glass of water. Any rational consumer\nwill not consume additional glass of water when it gives disutility or negative\nutility.\n14.4.1  Assumption of Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility\nThe law of diminishing marginal utility operates under certain specific conditions.\nThese are called assumptions of the law. Some important assumptions of the law\nare:.\n1.It is assumed that utility can be measured and a consumer can express his\nsatisfaction in quantitative terms like 1, 2, 3 etc. We have already said that unit\nof measurement of utility is ‘util’. So utility is cardinal.\n2.Quality of the commodity should not undergo any change. Take the above\nexample of glass of water. From the quality point of view a consumer who\ndrinks a glass of cold water must continue with the same. He or she cannot\nchange  its  quality  from  cold  to  normal  as  normal  water  give  different\nsatisfaction.\n3.Consumption  should  not  proceed  at  intervals.  It  should  be  a  continuous\nprocess.  Continuing  with  the  above  example,  second  glass  of  water,  if\nconsumed two hours after the first glass of water was consumed, may give\nmore, less or equal satisfaction.\n4.Consumer should be a rational person. This means that he/she prefers more\nquantity to less quantity of a good.\n5.Time  period  of  consumption  should  not  be  too  long.  Consumer’s  tastes,\nhabits, income etc. may change if the time gap is more.\n6.The price of the substitute and complementary goods should not change. If\nthese prices change, it may be difficult to predict about the utility derived from\nthe commodity in question."

He, therefore, presented an alternative technique\nknown as indifference curve approach (also called ordinal utility approach). It is\nbased on the assumption that every consumer has a scale of preference in the form\nof assigning ranks (like 1st 2nd, 3rd rank) to different combinations of two goods\ncalled bundle and can tell which bundle he likes most.\nBefore we proceed to discuss the consumer’s equilibrium through indifference\ncurve approach, let us understand some useful concepts related to indifference\ncurve analysis.\n(i)  Meaning of Indifference Curve\nWhen a consumer consumes various goods and services, then there are some\ncombinations  (bundles)  which  give  him  same  satisfaction.

In economics, they are not same. Desire means merely a wish to have a\ncommodity. It is simply craving for a commodity. So any body can desire anything,\nirrespective of whether that thing is really available or not. On the otherhand, want\nis the desire which is backed by ability and willingness to pay. So every desire is\nnot a want. Desire becomes a want only when the person is in a position to satisfy\nit.\nBy demand for a commodity we mean the desire for the commodity backed by\npurchasing  power  and  the  willingness  to  spend.  When  a  consumer  wishes  to\nconsume a commodity and has also the necessary purchasing power i.e. income\nalong with willingness to spend, he is said to have demand for the commodity.\nDemand  for  a  commodity  refers  to  the  quantity  of  a  commodity  that  a\nconsumer is willing to buy at a given price during a given period of time.\nThe definition of demand highlights three essential elements of demand:\n(i)    price of the commodity\n(ii)quantity of the commodity\n(iii)period of time: the time period may be a day, a week, a month, a year or any\nother period.\nLet us consider the following statements:\n(i)    Mr. Akshay purchased 2kgs. apples last week.\n(ii)   Mr. Akshay purchased 2Kgs. apples when the price of apples was ` 60 per kg.\n(iii)  Mr. Akshay purchased 2Kgs. apples last week when the price of apples     was\n` 60 per Kg.\nThe first two statements are incomplete in context of demand. In the first statement\nthe price of apples is not stated. In the second statement period of time is not stated.\nThe third statement is complete as it states the quantity of the apples, the price of\napples and the time period during which the said quantity is demanded.\n15.2  INDIVIDUAL DEMAND AND MARKET DEMAND\nIndividual demand for a commodity refers to the quantity of the commodity that\nan individual buyer is willing to buy at a given price during a given period of time.\nIn the example given in the beginning of the lesson Akshay’s demand for apple is\nthe individual demand for apple."

There may be other persons\nwho may demand apples in the market. Let us assume that besides Akshay there\nare three more buyers of apples in the market Rohit, Ritik and Ajai. Market demand\nfor apples will be the sum of demand of all the buyers of apples at a given price\nduring a given period of time.

The following factors affect the individual\ndemand for a commodity:\n1.   price of the commodity\n2.   price of related goods\n3.   income of buyer of the commodity\n4.   tastes and preferences of the buyer\n1.  Price of the Commodity\nYou must have observed that when price of a commodity falls, you tend to buy\nmore of it and when its price rises, you tend to buy less of it, when all other factors\nremain constant (‘other things remaining the same’). In other words, other things\nremaining the same, there is an inverse relationship between the price of a\ncommodity  and  its  quantity  demanded  by  its  buyers.  This  statement  is  in\naccordance with law of demand which you will study in the later part of this lesson."

So, ‘other things remaining the same’\nis an assumption when we study the effect of changes in the price of a commodity\non its quantity demanded.\n2.   Price of Related goods\nA consumer may demand a particular good. But while buying that good he/she also\nasks the price of its related goods.\nRelated goods can be of two types-\n(i)    Substitute goods\n(ii)Complementary goods\nWhile purchasing a good, prices of its substitutes and complements do affect its\nquantity purchased.\n(i)    Price of Substitute Goods: Substitute goods are those goods which can\neasily be used in place of one another for satisfaction of a particular\nwant, like tea and coffee. An increase in price of substitute good leads to an\nincrease  in  demand  for  the  given  commodity  and  a  decrease  in  price  of\nsubstitute good leads to a decrease in demand for the given commodity. It\nmeans demand for a given commodity is directly affected by change in price\nof substitute goods. For example, if price of coffee increases, the demand for\ntea will rise as tea will become relatively cheaper in comparison to coffee.\n(ii)   Price of Complementary goods: Complementary goods are those goods\nwhich are used together to satisfy a particular want like car and petrol. An\nincrease in the price of complementary goods leads to a decrease in demand\nfor the given commodity and a decrease in the price of complementary goods\nleads to an increase in demand for the given commodity. For example, if price\nof petrol falls then the demand for cars will increase as it will be relatively\ncheaper to use both the goods together. So, demand for a given commodity\nis inversely affected by change in price of complementary goods.\n3.   Income of the Buyer of Commodity\nDemand for a commodity is also affected by income of its buyer. However, the\neffect of change in income on demand depends on the nature of the commodity\nunder consideration.\nIn case of some goods like full cream milk, fine quality of rice (Basmati rice) etc,\ndemand for these commodities increases when income of the buyer increases and\ndemand for these commodities decreases when income of the buyer decreases.\nSuch goods, whose demand increases with the increase in income of the buyer, are\ncalled normal goods. But there are some goods like coarse rice, toned milk etc."

Such  goods,  whose  demand\ndecreases with the increase in income of the buyer, are called inferior goods.\nSuppose, a consumer buys 10 Kgs. of rice whose price is ` 25 per Kg. He cannot\nafford to buy better quality of rice because the price of such rice is ` 50 per Kg.\nThe consumer is spending ` 250 per month on the purchase of rice. Now, if income\nof the consumer increases and he can afford ` 350 on purchase of 10 Kg. of rice.\nNow he can afford to buy some quantity of rice, say 6 Kgs., whose price is ` 25\nper Kg. and may buy 4 Kgs. of rice whose price is ` 50 per Kg. Thus he will buy\n10 Kgs. of rice by spending ` 350 per month.\nTherefore, we may conclude that demand for normal goods is directly related to\nthe income of the buyer but demand for inferior goods is inversely related to the\nincome of the buyer.\n4.   Tastes and Preferences of the Buyer\nThe demand for a commodity is also affected by the tastes and preferences of the\nbuyers. They include change in fashion, customs, habits etc. Those commodities\nare  preferred  by  the  consumers  which  are  in  fashion.  So,  demand  for  those\ncommodities rises which are in fashion. On the other hand, if a commodity goes\nout of the fashion, its demand falls because no consumer will like to buy it.\n15.4   FACTORS AFFECTING MARKET DEMAND FOR A\nCOMMODITY\nAs stated earlier market demand is the total quantity of a commodity that all its\nbuyers taken together are willing to buy at a given price during a given period of\ntime. In addition to the factors affecting individual demand for a commodity,\nmarket demand is also influenced by the following factors:\n(i)  Number of Buyers in the Market(Population)\nIncrease in population raises the market demand, whereas decrease in population\nreduces the market demand for a commodity. Not only the size of population but\nits  composition  like  age  (ratio  of  males,  females,  children  and  old  people  in\npopulation) also affects the demand for a commodity. It is because of needs of\nchildren, young, old, male and female population differ.\n(ii)  Distribution of Income and Wealth\nIf the distribution of income and wealth is more in favour of the rich, demand for\nthe commodities preferred by the rich such as comforts and luxuries is likely to be\nhigher. On the other hand, if the distribution of income and wealth is more in favour\nof poor, demand for commodities preferred by the poor such as necessities will be\nmore."

Downward slope of demand curve shows the inverse relationship of price\nand quantity demanded of a commodity.\n15.6  ASSUMPTIONS OF LAW OF DEMAND\nIn law of demand all other factors except price of the commodity are assumed to\nbe constant. Therefore, we use the phrase ‘other things remaining same’. This\nphrase is used to cover the following assumptions on which the law is based:\n1.   Prices of substitute goods do not change.\n2.   Prices of complementary goods do not change.\n3.   Income of the buyer remains the same.\n4.   There is no change in tastes and preferences of the buyer.\n15.7  REASONS FOR OPERATION OF LAW OF DEMAND\nNow we will try to explain why does a consumer purchase more quantity of a\ncommodity at a lower price and less of it at a higher price or why does the law of\ndemand operate i.e. why does the demand curve slope downwards from left to\nright. The main reasons for operation of law of demand are:\n1.  Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility\nAs you have studied earlier, law of diminishing marginal utility states that as we\nconsume  more  and  more  units  of  a  commodity,  the  utility  derived  from  each\nsuccessive unit goes on decreasing. The consumer will be ready to pay more for\nthose units which provide him more utility and less for those which provide him\nless  utility.  It  implies  that  he  will  purchase  more  only  when  the  price  of  the\ncommodity falls.\n2.  Income Effect\nWhen price of a commodity falls, purchasing power or real income of the consumer\nincreases which enables him to purchase more quantity of the commodity with the\nsame money income. Let us take an example. Suppose you buy 4 ice creams when\nprice of each ice cream is ` 25. If price of ice creams falls to ` 20, then with same\nmoney income you can buy 5 ice creams now.\n3.  Substitution Effect\nWhen price of a commodity falls, it becomes comparatively cheaper as compared\nto its substitutes (although price of substitutes has not been changed). This will\nlead to rise in demand for the given commodity. For example, if coke and Pepsi"

Now coke has become relatively\ncheaper and will be substituted for Pepsi. It will lead to rise in demand for coke.\n4.  Change in Number of Buyers\nWhen  price  of  a  commodity  falls,  some  old  buyers  may  demand  more  of  the\ncommodity at the reduced price and some new buyers may also start buying this\ncommodity who were not in a position to buy it earlier due to higher price. This\nwill lead to increase in number of buyers when price of the commodity falls. As a\nresult demand for the commodity rises when its price falls.\n5.  Diverse Uses of a Commodity\nSome commodities have diverse uses, like milk. It can be used for drinking, for\nsweet preparation, for ice cream preparation etc. If price of milk rises, its use may\nbe restricted to important purpose only. This will lead to reduction in demand for\nother less important uses. When price of milk falls, it can be put to other uses also\nleading to rise n demand for it.\n15.8  EXCEPTIONS TO THE LAW OF DEMAND\nYou have studied in law of demand that a buyer is willing to buy more quantity of\na  commodity  at  a  lower  price  and  less  of  it  at  a  higher  price.  But  in  certain\ncircumstances, a rise in price may lead to rise in demand. These circumstances are\ncalled Exceptions to the Law of Demand. Some important exceptions are:\n1.  Giffen Goods\nGiffen goods are special type of inferior goods in which negative income effect is\nstronger  than  negative  substitution  effect.  Giffen  goods  do  not  follow  law  of\ndemand as their demand rises when their price rises. Examples of Giffen goods are\njowar and bajra etc.\n2.  Status Symbol Goods\nSome  goods  are  used  by  rich  people  as  status  symbols,  e.g.  diamonds,  gold\njewellary etc. The higher the price, the higher will be the demand for these goods.\nWhen price of such goods falls, these goods are no longer looked at as status\nsymbol goods and, tehrefore, therir demand falls.\n3.  Necessities\nCommodities such as medicines, salt, wheat etc. do not follow law of demand\nbecause we have to purchase them in minimum required quantity, whatever their\nprice may be."

This inverse relationship\nof price and quantity demanded by an individual buyer can also be explained with\nthe help of a schedule. Individual demand schedule shows different quantities\nof a commodity demanded by an individual buyer at different prices.

For example, a very small\nchange in price of luxury goods may affect their demand to a considerable extent\nbut a large change in price of salt may not affect its demand. This means, price\nelasticity of demand is different for different goods. Following factors may affect\nthe price elasticity of demand for a good:\n(i)    Availability of close substitutes: Demand for a commodity which has large\nnumber of substitutes, is usually more elastic than those commodities which\nhave no substitutes. For example, coke, Pepsi, limca etc. are good substitutes.\nEven  a  small  rise  in  price  of  coke  will  induce  the  buyers  to  go  for  its\nsubstitutes.  On  the  other  hand  demand  for  electricity  will  be  less  elastic\nbecause it has no close substitutes.\n(ii)   Nature of the Commodity: Demand for necessities like medicines, food\ngrains is less elastic because we have to consume them in minimum required\nquantity, whatever their price may be. But demand for comforts and luxuries\nlike refrigerators, air conditioners etc. is more elastic because their consumption\nmay be postponed for future if their price rises.\n(iii) Share in Total Expenditure: Greater the proportion of income spent on the\ncommodity, more is the elasticity of demand for it. Demand for a commodity\nis inelastic if proportion of income spent on that commodity is very small.\n(iv)  Level of Price: Demand for a commodity at higher level of price (like air\nconditioners, cars etc.) is generally more elastic than for a commodity at lower\nlevel of price (like match box, pencils etc.)\n(v)   Level of Income: Demand for a commodity is generally less elastic for higher\nincome level groups in comparison to people with low incomes.

In  previous  lessons,  you  have  studied  about\nconsumers, who constitute one part of the market and demand goods and services\nto  satisfy  their  wants.  Now,  you  will  study  the  other  part  of  the  market  -  the\nproducers  or  firms  who  produce  goods  and  services  for  the  satisfaction  of\nconsumers’ wants. A producer or firm combines various factors inputs like land,\nlabours, capital, entrepreneurship and other inputs like raw material, fuel etc. to\nproduce goods and services that are demanded by the consumers. Man can neither\nproduce a physical product nor can he distruct. Man can change only the form of\na physical product. He can create utilities only. Thus production means creation\nor addition of utility. Any activity that makes a product more useful is collect\nproduction. In this lesson you will study about how these inputs are combined  to\nproduce goods and services.\nOBJECTIVES\nAfter completing this lesson, you will be able to:\nzexplain the meaning of production;\nzdefine production function;\nzunderstand the meaning of production function in the short run known as law\nof variable proportions;\nzunderstand the different concepts of production and show their relationships;\nzdifferentiate between fixed and variable factors of production or inputs; and\nzexplain the reasons of operation of the laws of production."

It is the process of creating goods and services with the help of factors\nof  production  or  inputs  for  satisfaction  of  human  wants.  In  other  words,\n‘transformation of inputs into output’ whereby value is added, is broadly called\nproduction. Whatever is used in the production  of a commodity is called input. For\nexample,  in  the  production  of  wheat,  the  use  of  land,  seed,  fertilizer  water,\npesticides, tractors, labour etc. are inputs and wheat is output. The relationship\nbetween inputs and output of a commodity depends upon the state of technology\nbecause with the help of advanced technology more can be produced with the help\nof same inputs or same output can be produced with the help of less inputs.\nBefore defining production function we should understand the following concepts\nrelated to production function:\n(a)  Short run and long run\nShort run refers to a time period in which a firm does not have sufficient time to\nincrease the scale of output. It can increase only the level of output by increasing\nthe quantity of a variable factor and making intensive use of the existing fixed\nfactors. On the other hand long run refers to the time period in which the firms can\nincrease the scale of output by increasing the quantity of all the factor inputs\nsimultaneously and in the same proportion.\nThe distinction between fixed and variable factors is relevant only in the short run\nbut this distinction disappears in the long run.\n(b)  Fixed factors and variable factors\nFixed factors are those factors of production whose quantity can not be hanged\nwith change in the level of output. For example, the quantity of land, machinery\netc. can not be hanged during short run.\nOn the other hand, variable factors are those factors of production whose quantity\ncan easily be hanged with change in the level of output. For example, we can easily\nchange the quantity of labour to increase or decrease the production.\n(c)  Level of production and scale of production\nWhen any firm increases production by increasing the quantity of one factor input\nwhere as the quantity of other factor inputs keeping constant; it increases the level\nof production. But on the other hand, when the firms increases production by\nincreasing the quantity of all the factors of production simultaneously and in the\nsame proportion, it increases the scale of production."

In otherwords production function is\na mathematical functional/technical/engineering relationship between inputs and\noutput such that with a given combination of factor inputs and technology at a\ngiven period of time, the maximum possible output can be produced. Such as land,\nlabour capital and entrepreneurship.\nIf there are two factor inputs: labour (L) and capital (K), then production function\ncan be written as:\nQ\nx\n = f (L, K) where Q\nx\n is the quantity of output of commodity x, f is the function\nand L and k are the units of labour and capital respectively. It says that quantity of\noutput depends on units of labour on capital used in production.\nHere  two  points  are  worth  considering.  Firstly,  production  function  must  be\nconsidered with reference to particular period of time i.e. short period and long\nperiod. Secondly, production function is determined  by state of technology.\n(i) Short run production function\nA production function that shows the changes in output when only one factor is\nchanged while other factor remains constant is termed as a short run production\nfunction. In the above example of production funciton, Labour (L) is considered\nas the variable factor which can be changed to influence the level of output. The\nother factor capital (K) is a fixed factor which can not be changed. The underlying\ntheory to the short run production function is the “Law of variable proportion or\nReturns to a factor”. This law will be discussed later in this chapter.\n(ii) Long run production function\nA long run production function studies the impact on output when all the factors\nof production can be changed simultaneously and in the same proportion. So in the\nlong run size of operation of the firm can be expanded or contracted depending on\nthe fact that the factors of production are increased or decreased. The underlying\ntheory to the long run production function is the returns to scale which will be\ndiscussed later in this lesson:\nINTEXT QUESTIONS  17.1\n(i)    What is meant by production?\n(ii)Define a production function."

For example, 2 units of labour\ncombined with 2 units of capital can produce 26 fans per day. Here 26 fans is the\ntotal physical produt which is produced with the given level of inputs (labour and\ncapital)\n(b)  Average Physical Produt (APP)\nAPP is the output produced per unit of input employed. It can be obtained by\ndividing TPP by the number of units of variable input. So APP = TPP/L where L\nis the units of labour. For example, if 10 workers make 30 chairs per day, the APP\nof a worker per day will be 30 ÷ 10 = 3 chairs. If the productivity of a factor\nincreases, it implies that the output per unit of input has increased.\n(c)  Marginal Physical Product (MPP)\nMPP of an input is the additional output that can be produced by employing one\nmore unit of that input while keeping other inputs constant. For example, if ten\ntailors can make 50 shirts per day and 11 tailors can make 54 shirts per day, the\nmarginal product of 11 workers will be 54 - 50 = 4 shirts per day.\nWe can further clarify the above three concepts of production with the help of the\nfollowing table 17.1.\nTable showing TPP, APP and HPP of fans per day in short run."

For example, if we know the TPP of all the units of variable factor we an\ncalculate APP by dividing TPP by the number of units of a variable factor. So APP\n= TPP/units of variable factor. For example in table 17.1 the TPP of 2 units of\nlabour is 26, the APP will be 26 ÷ 2 = 13. In the same way we an calculate APP of\nall the units of a variable factor. We calculate MPP of 2 units labour by deducing\nTPP of 1 unit. From the TPP of 2 units labour i.e. 26 – 10 = 16 units. So MPPn =\nTPPn – TPPn – 1. If we know APP of all the units of a variable input we can\ncalculate TPP by multiplying APP by the units of variable factor. In the above table\nAPP of 4 units of labour is 17. TPP will be 17 × 4 = 68 units. In the source way\nwe an calculate TPP of all other units of variable factor. So TPP = APP × L where\nL is the units of labour. If we know MPP of all the units of a variable we an calculate\nTPP by summing up the MPP of all the units of variable factor. For example, in table\n17.1  the  MPP  of  1,  2,  3  and  4  units  of  labour  are  10,  16,  22  and  22  and  20\nrespectively, the TPP of 4 units of labour can be derived by summing up the MPP\nof these 4 units of labour i.e. 10 + 16 + 22 + 20 = 68 units. TPP of all other units\ncan be calculated in the same manner. Remember that for the 1 unit of labour TPP,\nAPP and MPP are equal. So we can give the following formulas to calculate TPP,\nAPP and MPP.\nTPP = 6MPP (Sum of MPP of all the units of a variable factor)\norTPP = MPP\n1\n + MPP\n2\n + MPP\n3\n + ............

This law was initially called the law of dimiting\nreturns  Marshall  who  applied  the  law  only  in  agriculture  sector  but  modern\neconomist called it the law of variable proprotion and proposed its applicability to\nall the sectors of the economy.\nAssumption of the law\nThe law operates under the following assumptions:\n(i)    The firm operates in the short run.\n(ii)There is no change in technology of production.\n(iii)The production process allows the different factor ratios to produce different\nlevels out output.\n(iv)All the units of variable factor are equally efficient.\n(v)   Full substitutability of factors of production is not possible.\nAccording to the law when we employ more and more units of a variable factor\nwith the fixed quantity of other factors and technology, the marginal product of the\nvariable factor first increases and then decreases. In other words, with employment\nof more and more units of a variable factor with fixed quantity of other factors, the\ntotal product first increases and then starts decreasing. It means that in short run\nlabour is the only variable factor, Return to labour or marginal product of labour\ninitially increases but as more units of labour are employed its MPP declines and\nmay also become negative. There are three phases of returns to a variable factor\nwhich are discussed below.\n(a) Phase I: Increasing Returns to a factor\nIn this phase TPP increases at an increasing rate and marginal product of variable\nfactor, labour increases. In the end of this phase MPP is maximum. So, this is the\nphase of increasing returns to a factor.\n(b) Phase II: Diminishing Returns to a factor\nIn this phase TPP increases but at a diminishing rate MPP declines but remains\npositive. At the end of this phase MPP is zero. At this point TPP is maximums. So,\nthis is the phase of diminishing returns to a factor.\n(c) Phase III: Negative Returns to a factor\nIn this phase, MPP declines and it becomes negative. Here the TPP also starts\nfalling.  It  operates  from  the  level  of  output  where  MPP  of  labour  is  zero  but\nsubsequently becomes negative.

In this phase MPP\nbecomes negative after point D.\n17.7  REASONS  BEHIND  DIFFERENT  PHASES  OF  THE\nLAW OF VARIABLE PROPORTIONS\nIn phase I, we get increasing returns to a variable input because greater use of\nvariable inputs makes it possible to utilize fixed indivisible factor more efficiently\nand also to introduce a greater division of labour and specialization. It leads to\noptimum combination of fixed and variable inputs.\nIn phase II, we get diminishing returns to a variable input because in this stage the\nproportion between variable and fixed inputs has crossed the optimum proportion\nbetween them and a variable input such as labour has less and less fixed input to\nwork with.\nIn phase III, the variable input becomes too much relative to fixed inputs which\nobstructs the production process and therefore results in fall of TPP. because MPP\nbecomes negative. So, phase III is called the stage of negative returns to variable\nfactor. So phase III is called the stage of negative returns to variable factor.\n17.8  LAW OF DIMINISHING MARGINAL PRODUCT\nThe law of variable proportions is an extension of the law of diminishing returns\nto a factor. The law of diminishing returns to a factor states that as more and more\nunits  of  a  variable  factor  are  employed  with  fixed  factors  and  technology,  its\nmarginal product eventually declines. The difference between this law and the law\nof variable proportions is that the former does not take into account increasing\nreturns to a factor. According to the law of diminishing returns to a factor, the firm\ncan operate only in phase II and III of the law of variable proportions. Hence the\nlaw of diminishing returns to a factor is a part of more general law of variable\nproportions. In figure 17.2, the law of diminishing returns to a factor operates after\npoint A on TPP curve and point C on MPP curve.\nEarly economists believed that the diminishing returns to a factor sets in only in\nagriculture as land was fixed. It did not apply in industry as this sector continuously\nunderwent technical upgradation. However, industry can postpone setting in of\ndiminishing returns with technical advances. If technical advancements do not take\nplace there is no increase in the efficiency of the factor inputs, then diminishing\nreturns shall be applicable even in industry. According to modern economists,\ndiminishing returns under the law of variable proportions are universally applicable\nto both the agriculture and industrial sectors."

It cannot be ignored at any cost\nfor the success of any business organisation. On anlysis of cost is required. A\nproducer can supply/produce the product by organising the factors of produciton.\nThat means the producer has to hire or purchase land, labour, capital, etc. by paying\nprice. So, to produce the product the firm or producer must incur some expenditure\nand the expenditure so involved is called cost of production. This lesson is aimed\nat discussing this aspect of production called cost of production.\nOBJECTIVES\nAfter completing this lesson, you will be able to:\nzdefine cost of production;\nzdistinguish between the meaning of cost as used in business and as used in\neconomics;\nzexplain  the  meaning  and  importance  of  various  concepts  of  cost  such  as,\nexplicit cost, implicit cost and normal profit, fixed costs and variable costs; and\nzfind  out  total  fixed  cost,  total  variable  cost,  average  fixed  cost,  average\nvariable cost, average total cost and marginal cost.\n18.1  DEFINITION  OF COST AND COST FUNCTION\nCost is defined as the expenditure incurred by a firm or producer to purchase or\nhire factors of production in order to produce a product. As you know, factors of\nproduction  are  land,  labour,  capital  and  entrepreneurship.  In  the  production\nprocess,  the  entrepreneur  organises  land,  labour,  capital  and  raw  materials  to\nproduce output. As a producer he/she has to pay rent for land, wages to labour and\ninterest to procure capital. The producer must also be compensated for his/her"

Wages, rent, interest, profit are called factor\ncosts of production. Besides these, the producer also incurs expenditure on raw\nmaterials, electricity, water, depreciation of capital goods such as machines and\nindirect taxes etc. The producer also uses the services of certain factors supplied\nby his/her own self. The imputed value of such inputs also form the part of cost.\nCost Function\nSince the producer who produces output incurs cost, we can say that cost is a\nfunction of output. It means that cost of production will increase or decrease,\ndepends on whether level output is increasing or decreasing.\nIn the lesson on production, you have studied that output depends on factors of\nproduction such as labour, capital. Hence cost is related to expenditure on these\nfactors.  If  the  producer  hires  more  amount  of  factors,  cost  will  automatically\nincrease and vice versa.\n18.2  TYPES OF COST\n(a) Explicit Costs (Money Costs)\nA firm purchases the services of assets like building, machine etc. It pays hiring\ncharges for building, normally termed as rent. It employs workers, accountant\nmanager etc. and pays wages and salaries to them. It borrows money and pays\ninterest on it. It purchases raw material, pays electricity bills and makes such other\npayments. All such actual payments, on purchasing and hiring different goods and\nservices used in production are called ‘explicit costs’.\nNormally, in business, the accountant takes into account only the actual money\nexpenditure as cost. So in business the cost is normally the ‘explicit cost’ only.\n(b) Implicit costs (Imputed costs) :\nMany a times, we find that all inputs are not always bought or hired by the producer\nfrom the market. Some of the inputs are provided by the entrepreneur or producer\nhimself. He may use his own building. He may invest his own money in the business.\nHe may be the manager of his own firm. A farmer may cultivate his own land. If\na producer had taken a building from another production unit, he would have paid\nrent. In the same way, if he had borrowed money he would have paid a certain\namount of interest. Similarly, if he had engaged a manager he would have paid him\na salary. But he is not paying these amounts explicitely i.e. (rent for his building,\ninterest on his money and salary for his services) because he has contributed them\nfor his own business. So market value of these self-owned and self supplied inputs\nmust be calculated. It is, therefore, a cost to the producer. We can make an estimate"

Let us term such costs\nas ‘implicit costs’  (to distinguish them from explicit costs). These are also termed\nas imputed costs. One example of such cost is the imputed rent of the self owned\nfactory building. It can be taken as equivalent to the actual rent paid for a similar\ntype of building. Similarly, we can find out imputed interest and imputed wages.\nIn microeconomics, in addition to the paid out cost, imputed cost is also included\nin the cost of production.\nOpportunity cost\nEconomists define opportunity cost as the value of next best alternative foregone.\nWhat does this mean? It is a common practicve that a person makes a list of several\nactivities before adopting a particular one to persue his/her goal. Similarly, in\nproduction a producer leaves some alternatives before finally choosing to produce\nthe particular output. So, while finally choosing one, the producer did forego the\nalternative production. Let us take example of a farmer. He can produce either rice\nor wheat on a piece of land. If he has decided to produce wheat on this piece of\nland, he has to forego the produciton of rice for producing wheat. So, value of rice\nforegone (next best alternative) is the opportunity cost of producing wheat.\n18.3  NORMAL PROFIT AS COST OF PRODUCTION\nAnother component of cost is ‘normal profit’. Normal profit is an additional\namount  over  the  monetary  and  imputed  cost  that  must  be  received  by  an\nentrepreneur  to  induce  him  to  produce  the  given  product.  Normal  profit  is\nentrepreneur’s  opportunity  cost  and  therefore  enters  into  cost  of  production.\nOpportunity cost is the value of the opportunity or alternative that is sacrificed.\nYou may be wondering how is it that profit is an element of cost. We will try to\nconvince you.\nFor that let us first understand the meaning of the term ‘normal profit’. It is\nnothing but the minimum assured profit in the next best occupation. Normal profit\nis the reward which an entrepreneur must receive for the risk and uncertainties he\nbears in the production of a commodity. It can be understood with an example.\nSuppose there is a publisher who has the option of publishing commerce books or\nscience books. He chooses to publish commerce books because he gets higher\nreturn  from  these.  Now,  suppose,  that  the  market  for  science  books  is  more\nassured but profit is lower. This would mean that the publisher who is publishing\ncommerce books is sacrificing an assured return on science books and is taking a\nrisk. He would be prepared to face the risk only when he thinks that he would be\nable to get at least the same profit which he would have in any way got from science\nbooks. Loss of assured return on science books is then an element of cost for the"

It is termed\nas ‘normal profit’ because it is an estimate of the minimum expectations of a\nproducer from a business. So long as he gets this minimum, he will continue to\npublish commerce books. If, at any stage, he does not get this amount, he will shift\nto  the  publication  of  science  books.  So,  in  order  that  a  producer  continues  to\nproduce a commodity he must get normal profit in addition to recovering his\n‘explicit cost’ and ‘implicit cost’. We hope you are now convinced that minimum\nexpectation of a producer from a business is also an element of cost.\nThere are three elements of the total cost of production in micro economics\n(a)   Explicit costs\n(b)   Implicit costs and\n(c)   Normal profits.\nIn business accounts only explicit costs are treated as cost.\nLet us consider an example of the total cost elements for a farmer, He requires\nfollowing inputs to produce say rice; a piece of land; agricultural workers; tools\nand implements; tractor and harvester; water, seeds, manures, power, and many\nother things.

These are private costs for the\nfirms. Thus private costs are the expenditure of an individual firm in producing a\ncommodity.\n(b) Social Costs\nFactories emit large amount of smoke from their chimneys into the atmosphere.\nThis may not figure in the calculation of costs in their records. But the cost to the\ncommunity may be in the form of additional washing bills for clothes and the money\nspent by the community on medical bills etc. These costs are social costs.\n18.5  MONEY COST VS REAL COST\nThe explicit cost and the private cost referred above are actually incurred by the\nproducer in money terms. So, they are also called money cost. Wage to labour, rent\nfor building, interest on borrowed funds etc. are paid in monetary units and hence\ncalled money cost.\nReal cost, on the otherhand, has no definite money value nor it can be measured\nin monetary terms. A producer makes a lots of sacrifices and toils hard to set up\nbusiness. The pain, discomfort, stress and strain that he/she undergoes cannot be\nmeasured  in  money.  This  is  called  real  cost  to  the  producer.  The  sacrifice,\ndiscomfort, disutility, toils and efforts involved in supplying factors of production\nby their owners make real cost of production."

Accordingly,\ncost of production is calculated depending on whether production is taking place\nin short run or in the long run.\nCost in the short run: Fixed vs variable cost : In the short run two types of\nfactors  are  identified.  One,  fixed  factors  which  cannot  be  changed  and  two,\nvariable factors which can be changed to increase output. Fixed costs are those\ncosts which do not change with any changes in the quantity of production or size\nof output during period. They remain constant during the whole period at any level\nof output. Whether the production is zero or less or more. Then cost are fixed in\nnature. Fixed costs are also known as supplementary cost. Let the rent of a factory\nbuilding paid by the producer is ` 1000 per month. Whether the producer produces\nthe output or not, he/she has to pay the rent after hiring the building.\nOn the other hand variable cost are those cost which vary with the change in the\nquantity of output or production. They do not remain constant and are variable in\nnature. There cost increase with increase in output and decrease with a decrease\nin output. These costs are related to variable factor of production. They are also\nknown as direct cost or prime cost. For example, labour is called variable factor\nin the short run. So, wage paid to labour is a variable cost. In order to increase\noutput, producer can hire more units of labour. So, the expenditure on wages will\nincrease. If output level is to be reduced, then producer can reduce the amount of\nlabour and accordingly less amount of wage will be paid. So variable cost varies\nwith change in level of output.\n18.7  CALCULATION OF FIXED AND VARIABLE COST\nTFCTotal expenditure on fixed factors is called total fixed cost (TFC)\nTVC    Total expenditure on variable factors is called total variable cost (TVC)\nTCSum of TFC and TVC is the total cost (TC)\nTC = TFC + TVC\n(c) Illustration\nThe concepts of fixed costs and variable costs can be understood better with the\nhelp of a schedule and an illustration. Suppose, a firm producing pens incurs the\nfollowing costs at different levels of output (as given in Table 18.1): You will see\nthat its fixed cost remains constant whereas variable cost changes with every\nchange in level of output. In this schedule, the fixed cost is ` 60 and remains the"

In the previous section we have learnt that production costs are\nclassified into fixed cost and variable cost.\nThese two costs together make total cost\n i.e.,TC = TFC + TVC\nwhere TC stands for total cost, TFC for total fixed cost and TVC for total variable\ncost.\nWhen a production unit is established but there is no production, total cost is the\nsame  as  the  total  fixed  cost.  As  production  takes  place,  variable  cost  is  also\nincurred and so total cost changes. Total cost increases as the quantity of output"

As one unit of pen is produced by the\nproducer the total cost rises to ` 120. So the marginal cost of producing one unit\nof output is ` 60 (` 120-` 60). When it produces 2 units his total cost increases to\n` 160; the marginal cost at 2 units of output is ` 40 (` 160-` 120). This has been\ncalculated by deducting total cost of 1 unit from total cost of 2 units. Marginal cost\nat one unit of output is ` 60. This we got by deducting total cost of zero unit from\ntotal cost of one unit.\nIt should be kept in mind that marginal cost is dependent on the variable cost only.\nIt is not affected by fixed cost because fixed cost remains constant. As output\nexpands, changes in total cost are due to changes in variable cost only. So, marginal\ncost can also be calculated if only total variable costs are known to us.

So this\ncase the supply of wheat is 50 quintals but the actual sale is 30 quintals. So these\ntwo concepts should not be confused with each other. Like demand supply also has\nthree elements. The definition of supply include (i) the quantity of the commodity\nthat a firm is willing to supply (ii) the price at which it is willing to supply that\nquantity and (iii) the time period during which it is willing to supply that quantity.\n19.2   FACTORS  DETERMINING  SUPPLY  OR  DETER-\nMINANTS OF SUPPLY OF A GOOD\nThe main determinant of supply is the price of the commodity. But the cost of\nproduction of a commodity is an important factor in determining profit maximized\non output of a firm. The cost of production depends on the prices of various inputs,\nlike raw material, wages of workers, interest of capital, rent of building etc. The\nsupply of a commodity also depends on the technology used in the production of\nthe commodity and many other factors. The main factors determining supply of a\ncommodity are\n(i)    Price of the commodity\n(ii)Price of other related good\n(iii)Price of inputs/factors\n(iv)  Taxation policy of government\n(v)   Objective of the firm\n(i)    Price  of  the  commodity:  Other  factors  determining  supply  remaining\nconstant, there is a direct relationship between price and quantity supplied of\na commodity. It means the quantity supplied of a commodity increases with\nrise in price and decreases with fall  in price of the commodity. More quantity\nof a commodity is supplied at a higher price and less quantity is supplied at\na lower price. For example a seller of tomatoes is willing to sell 100 kgs of\ntomatoes at a price of ` 40 per keg and only 50 kgs at a price of ` 20 per kg.\nDue  to  this  direct  relationship  between  price  and  quantity  supplied  of    a\ncommodity the supply curve has a positive slope. Supply curve is upward\nsloping to the right.\n(ii)   Price of other related goods: Supply of a commodity is also influenced by\nthe change in the price of other related goods. With the help of given resources"

This helps the\nfirm to diversify and tide over fluctuations in demand. For example, a farmer\ncan produce either pulses or food grains by using the resources. If the price\nof  pulses  increases  it  becomes  more  profitable  for  him  to  make  more\nproduction of pulses. So he will divert some resources from the production\nof food grains to the production of pulses. The production of pulses will\nincrease and that of food grains will decrease. So the supply of pulses will\nincrease if the price of pulses increases and the supply of food grain will\ndecrease at the same price reverse will happen if the price of food grains\nincreases.\n(iii)Price of inputs/factors: Change in the price of inputs like raw material, wage,\nrent or interest also influences the supply of a commodity. For example, in the\nproduction of cloth, cotton is the main raw material. If the price of cotton\nincreases, the cost of production of cloth will increase. At the same price, the\nmargin of profit will decrease. So the producer will decrease the supply of\ncloth at the same price. On the other hand if the price of cotton falls, the cost\nof production per unit of cloth will decrease and hence the supply of cloth will\nincrease. The price of other inputs will also influence the supply of a good in\nthe same manner.\n(iv)  Technology of production: an improvement in the technology of production\nof a commodity decreases the per unit cost of the commodity. The margin of\nprofit will increase at the same price. So the supply of a commodity will\nincrease, with improvement in technology of production, at the same price.\nOn the other hand if a firm uses absolute technology of production, the cost\nof production per unit of the commodity will increase. The margin of profit\nwill decrease, so the firm will decrease its supply at the same price. This is the\nmain reason that the firms are trying to use better technology of production\nbecause it not only reduces the cost of production per unit but also improves\nthe quality of the product.\n(v) Taxation policy of government: If the government reduces the excise duty\nor  the  production  of  a  commodity,  the  cost  of  production  per  unit  of  the\ncommodity will decrease, the margin of profit will increase at the same price\nso the producer of the commodity will increase its supply. It happens when\nthe government wants to increase the production of the commodity. On the\nother  hand  to  discourage  the  production  of  some  harmful  goods,  like\ncigarettes, liquor etc, the government increases the rate of excise duty on the\nproduction  of  such  goods.  So  the  cost  of  production  per  unit  of  the\ncommodity increases and the supply of such commodities decreases.\n(vi)  Objective of the firm: The objective of the producer also influences the\nsupply of a commodity. Generally, the objective of a producer is get maximize\nhis profits. Profits are maximized at a higher price. So he increases the supply"

So a supply function can be expressed as:\nS\nn\n = f(P\nn\n, P\nr\n, P\nf\n, T, T\nr\n, G)\nwhere    S\nn\n=  Supply of commodity n\nPn  =  Price of the commodity n\nPr  =  Price of other related goods\nPf  =  Price of inputs/factors\nT  =  Technology of production\nTr  =  Government policy or tax rate\nG  =  Goal or objective of the producer\nTypically  supply  function  shows  the  relationship  between  price  and  quantity\nsupplied, keeping all other determinants of supply as constant. It shows the amount\nof a good that a seller supplies at different levels of price.\nFor example, a supply function can be\nqs = –15 + 3P"

The sign before\np is always positive which indicates that the price and quantity supplied are directly\nrelated and the supply curve is upward sloping to the right. Here +3 means that the\nevery unit increase in price there is an increase of 3 units in supply. –15 in the supply\nfunction represents the point at which the supply cur e cuts x-axis.\nWe can derive a supply schedule with the help of supply function.\nTable 19.1: Supply schedule of commodity x\nPrice of unit (\n``\n``\n`)Quantity supplied per unit of time (units)\n50\n63\n76\n89\n912\nThe above table shows that for the price levels more that ` 5, there is a positive\nquantity supplied.

This law\nstates that there is a direct relationship between price and quantity supplied of a\ncommodity,  other  factors  determining  supply  remaining  constant.  It  means\nquantity supplied of a commodity increases with increase in price and decreases\nwith decrease in price.\n19.4.1 Assumptions of the law of supply\nThe phrase other determinants of supply remaining constant in the law of supply\nshows the assumptions of the law of supply.

But the problem is that all the\ncommodities do not respond in the same way to change in price. Some commodities\nare more responsive to change in price than others. For example, if the price of a\ncommodity increases by 20 percent and it quantity supplied increase by 40 percent.\nIn this case the supply of the commodity is very elastic because percentage in\nquantity supplied of the commodity is double the percentage change in its price."

The main factors determining elasticity of\nsupply are given below.\n(i) Nature of the commodity\nThe supply of perishable goods like fresh vegetables and fresh fruits is generally\ninelastic because it is very difficult to store them for future sale. These goods are\nprone to getting spoiled quickly and can not be kept for long period of time. So the\nsupply of such goods does not change according to change in price. It is so because\nthe seller prefers to sell them at cheaper rates than to spoil the goods totally.\nOn the other hand durable goods made by the industries do not get easily spoiled.\nIf the price of such goods falls, they can easily be stored for sale when the price\nrises. So, the supply of such goods is more elastic to change in price. The goods\nwhose supply can be postponed for future are more elastic than the goods whose\nsupply can not be postponed for future."

In such cases, the producer is not\ninterested in increasing the production in substantial quantity. The supply of such\ngoods is relatively inelastic.\nOn the other hand if the marginal cost of additional unit decreases per unit, the\nproducer will be motivated to increase the output with a little increase in price. In\nsuch a case the supply of the commodity is more elastic.\n(iii) Time Period\nTime period also influences the case with which the supply of the commodity can\nbe changed. During very short period, supply can not be changed according to\nchange in price. So the supply of the commodity is perfectly inelastic. During short\nperiod, the supply of the commodity can be changed by changing only variable\nfactor and keeping all other factors as constant.

Market is the major source of distribution\nof goods and services. The purpose of producing goods is to sell them to the\nconsumers  who  demand  them.  To  sell  the  goods  (and  services)  we  need  the\nmedium of market. In today’s world a buyer can get so many types of goods in the\nmarket. What are the different forms of market?

Without market, producers’\nand consumers’ activities hardly make any sense. In common parlance, market is\nassumed to be a place where goods are bought and sold. But in economics, the term\n‘market’ does not refer to a specific place. Rather, it is a mechanism through which\nbuyers and sellers come into contact with each other and buy and/or sell goods at\nmutually agreed prices."

It is only after the contact between the buyer and\nthe seller, that a transaction takes place.\n(b)Area: You can easily find a market place nearer to a human settlement. But\nin today’s world, the market is not limited to a particular place. Today, in the\nage of Internet, we have a rapidly growing online market which is not limited\nto any geographical area. A buyer can place order to buy a good online. So\nmodern Market exists physically and virtually.\n(c)Commodity: The transaction between buyer and seller has to be over some\ngood or service. So a commodity becomes the integral part of a market.\n(d)Different forms of Competition: Forms of market depends on the degree of\ncompetition  among  the  sellers  selling  the  goods,  where  the  degree  of\ncompetition it self is determined by the inter relationship of among the goods\nand services sold by different sellers as well on number of sellers present in\nthe market.\n(e)   Money transaction: Money is the mediums of exchange in the modern day\nworld. Consumers pay money to the seller to buy goods as services in the\nmarket. So money and market are inseparable.\n21.2  BASIS  OF  DIFFERENT  MARKET  FORMS\nDifferent forms of market can exist on the basis of some distinguished characteristics.\nSome of these characteristics are:\n(a)Number of Firms: Number of firms in a market indicates the degree of\ncontrol of a firm on the price of a commodity. For example, if there is a large\nnumber of firms competing against each other, a single firm supplies just a\nminiscule part of market supply and hence cannot influence the market supply\nand consequently the price significantly. Similarly, if there is only one firm in\nthe  market,  it  becomes  the  sole  determinant  of  the  market  supply  and\ntherefore, exercises a great degree of control over the price.\n(b)Ease of Entry and Exit of the Firms: If the firms can easily enter a particular\nmarket or can leave the market without much loss, the price will be stable and\nprofits will be just normal in the long run. In case there are restrictions on entry\nof  new  firms,  the  degree  of  control  of  existing  firms  increases  and  the\npossibility of earning higher profits also increases as the firms have a lesser\ndegree of competition in such a case.\n(c)Degree of Product Differentiation: It simply means how unique the product\noffered by a particular firm is.

Perfect Competition is a market structure in which there is a large number\nof buyers and sellers who transact homogeneous or similar goods at a price fixed\nby the market or industry. Here, industry is a group of firms producing similar\ngoods.\nFeatures of Perfect Competition: Perfect Competition is characterized by:\n1.Very  Large  number  of  buyers  and  sellers: In  a  perfectly  competitive\nmarket, there is a very large number of buyers and sellers. For instance, if a\nsingle seller tries to raise the price, there is a large number of other sellers\nselling identical product at a lower price. Therefore, the demand for this\nparticular firm decreases forcing it to come in line again with the industry\ndetermined price.\n2.Homogeneous  Product: The  products  offered  by  different  firms  are\nhomogeneous in every respect so that the buyer does not have any basis to\nprefer the goods of one seller over the goods of another seller. The goods are\nidentical in terms of quality, size, packing, and other terms of deal etc. This\nfeature ensures the uniformity of the price throughout the market.\n3.Firm is a Price Taker: The firm has to sell the goods at a price determined\nby  the  industry  as  the  firm  has  no  control  over  the  price.  The  market  or\nindustry determines this price on the basis of market demand and market\nsupply as shown in the figure. So industry is the price maker and firm is the\nprice taker.\n4.Free Entry and Exit: Under perfect competition firms are free to enter into\nthe market or exit from the market at any point of time. This means that there\nis no obstruction from any where for a new firm to produce the same product\nproduced by the existing firms in the market; similarly if a firm wishes to exit\nthen it is free to do so.\n5.Perfect Knowledge: This feature implies that both sellers and buyers have\nperfect knowledge about the goods and their prices so that it is not possible\nfor a firm to charge a different price. It also ensures uniform price for the\nbuyers and uniform cost function for the producers.\n6.Perfect Mobility: The goods as well as the factors of production are perfectly\nmobile so that there is no restriction- legal or monetary (involving expenditure\nin movement of goods). This feature ensures that the price throughout the\nmarket tends to be uniform.\n7.No Selling Costs: Selling costs are the costs aimed at promotion of sales of\nproduct of a firm, e.g. expenditure on advertisement of a product. In perfect\ncompetition, there is no need to incur selling cost because of assumption of"

This implies that if people have\ncomplete knowledge about the product, the seller does not find it necessary\nto educate consumers through advertisements. Similarly, when goods are\nhomogeneous, there is no basis on which the seller can claim superiority of\nhis products over the products of its rivals.\n8.Shape of Demand Curve: Under perfect competition, the demand curve for\nthe firm is horizontal and perfectly elastic.

The\nwhole industry consists of this single firm. Thus, under monopoly, there is no\ndistinction between firm and industry. Being the only firm, there is significant\ncontrol of the firm over supply and price. Thus under monopoly, buyers do\nnot have the option of buying the commodity from any other seller. They have\nto buy the product from the firm or they can go without the commodity. This\nfact gives immense control to the monopolist over the market.\n2.No Close Substitute: There are no close substitutes of the product produced\nby the monopolist firm. If there are close substitutes of the product in the\nmarket, it implies presence of more than one firm and hence no nonopoly.  In\norder to ensure a total of control over the market by the monopolist firm, it\nis assumed that there are no close substitutes of the product.\n3.No to Entry: Monopoly can only exist when there is strong barriers before\na new firm to enter the market. In fact once a monopoly firm starts producing\nthe produt, no other firm can produce the same. One reason for this is the\nability of the monopolist to produce the product at a lower cost than any new\nfirm who thinks to enter the market. If a new firm who knows that it can not\nproduce at a lower cost than the monopolist, then the that firm will never enter\nthe market for fear of loosing out in competition. Similarly the monopolist\nwho  is  operating  for  a  long  time  may  be  enjoying  reputation  among  its\ncustomers and is in a better position to use the situation in its own benefit. A\nnew firm has to take long time to achieve this and so may not be interested\nto enter the market.\n4.Price Maker: Being the single seller of the product, the monopolist has full\ncontrol over the pricing of the product. On the other hand, if there is a large\nnumber of buyers in the market, so no single buyer exercises any significant\ninfluence over price determination. Thus, it is a seller’s market. So monopoly\nfirm is a price maker.\n5.Price Discrimination: Having consider-\nable control over the market on account\nof being single seller with no entry of\nother firms, the monopolist can exercise\npolicy of price discrimination, it means\nthat  the  monopolist  can  sell  different\nquantities  of  the  same  product  to  a\nconsumer  at  different  price  or  same\nquantity  to  different  consumers  at\ndifferent prices by adjudging the standard\nof living of the consumer.\nPrice\nY\nO\nQuantity demanded\nX\nD\nFig. 21.2"

Thus, product differentiation\nis the cornerstone of Monopolistic Competition. Monopolistic competition is like\nan amalgam of monopoly and perfect competition, and hence the name Monopolistic\nCompetition. According to J.S. Bains, “Monopolistic Competition is a market\nstructure where there is a large number of sellers, selling differentiated but close\nsubstitute products.”\nExample: Restaurants, Market for Toothpaste etc.\nFeatures of Monopolistic Competition\nMonopolistic Competition is characterized by:\n1.Large number of firms: Under monopolistic competition, there is a large\nnumber  of  firms  selling  closely  related  products.  Thus  the  control  of  a\nparticular firm is somewhat diminished when compared to that of monopoly.\n2.Product Differentiation: Product Differentiation is a very important feature\nof Monopolistic Competition. This differentiation could be on the basis of\nquality,  packaging,  colour  etc.  or  this  differentiation  could  also  be  just  a\nmatter of perception.\nFor example: You must have seen different brands of tooth paste. Even if they\nlook different having different taste, the produt it has same use."

Oligopoly can simply be defined as the competition among the few\nfirms. The products of these firms may either be close substitutes or homogeneous.\nExample: Mobile service providers, car industry, airlines etc.\nA. Features of Oligopoly\nOligopoly is characterized by following features:\n1.Interdependence: Interdependence is a very significant feature of Oligopoly.\nWhen the number of firms is small, any strategy regarding change in price,\noutput  or  quality  of  a  product,  will  depend  on  the  rival’s  reaction  for  its\nsuccess. Thus, the success of price reduction policy by one company (say,\nPepsi) will depend on reaction by its rival (say, Coke). For example, if Pepsi\nlowers the price per bottle from Rs 10 to Rs 8, the effect of this step on demand\nfor Pepsi will depend on the counter-strategy of Coke. If Coke decides to\nfollow price war strategy and lowers price from Rs 10 per bottle to Rs 7 per\nbottle, demand for Pepsi may decrease even below its initial level.\n2.Indeterminate Demand Curve: Demand curve presents different quantities\nof a product demanded at various prices. However, demand for a product at\ndifferent prices can be known only when rivals’ counter strategies can be\npredicted with certainty. This being not possible, we cannot draw the usual\ndemand curve for the firm’s product in case of oligopoly.\n3.Selling Costs: Oligopoly firms bear selling cost such as advertisement, sales\npromotion etc. to sale the product.\n4.Group Behaviour: Since there are a few firms under oligopoly, there is a\ntendency among them to come together in order to avoid competition. They\nmay meet secretly to negotiate price and quantity in the market. The aim is to\nmaximise profit in the same manner as a monopolist does. Obviously when\nthey come together it looks as if all firms have become a single entity like a\nmonopolist. But such groupism is done secretly as the government may take\naction if it comes to know about this type of group behaviours of firm where\nin firms are trying to reduce competition among them selves. Note that when\nfirms form a group secretly to share profit or quantity etc. it is called collusive\noligopoly. When firms work independently and compete with each other, it is\ncalled non-collusive oligopoly.\n5.Price Rigidity: In oligopoly market, once the price of the produt is fixed by\nthe firms, it is normally not changiable.

So response of change in quantity due to change in price many vary\nfrom one firm to another creating uncertainty about future sales. So fearing\nthis firms do not change price once its is fixed.\nB. Types of Oligopoly\nOligopoly may further be classified into collusive oligopoly and non-collusive\noligopoly.\n(a)  Collusive  oligopoly\nThe firms under oligopoly may decide to co-operate with each other and make\ncommon policies for all the firms. Thus, firms may collude with each other work\non  common  pricing  policies  and  make  common  output  decisions.  In  such  an\nenvironment, the group of firms can behave like a monopolist and earn supernormal\nprofits. This group of colluding firms is called ‘cartel’. One prominent example of\ncartel is ‘the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (PEC)’.\n(b)  Non-collusive  oligopoly\nWhen firms do not co-operate with each other and engage in fierce competition\nwith  each  other,  the  market  is  called  non-collusive  oligopoly.

The price\nof the commodity is determined at the level of the industry through the interaction\nof the forces of demand and supply of the commodity in the market.

      "content": "Notes\n 157\nPrice  Determination  Under  Perfect  Competition\nECONOMICS\nMODULE - 8\nMarket and Price\nDetermination\nLet us assume that the initial price is ` 6 per kg and the respective levels of quantity\ndemanded and supplied are 16 and 24 kg respectively. Obviously, quantity supplied\nat this price is exceeding quantity demanded. So, the suppliers or producers will\noffer a lower price to the buyers to ensure that their goods do not remain unsold.\nSo, the price gradually moves from ` 6 to ` 5 per kg. At this relatively lower price,\ndemand expands to 18 kg while supply contracts to 22 kg (in accordance with the\nrespective laws of demand and supply), but still there is a gap between supply and\ndemand. So the suppliers still feel that all of their goods might not sell in the market\nas quantity demanded is less than quantity supplied. So, they reduce price further\nso as to ensure that their goods do not remain unsold. This process continues till\nthe price level reaches a point where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied.\nThus, when the price falls from ` 5 to ` 4, quantity demanded as well as quantity\nsupplied is equal to 20 kg. Now the suppliers have no reason to reduce their price\nfurther. Hence as long as quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded, price\nof the commodity keeps falling till both become equal.\nNote that, when supply exceeds demand, we call it excess supply that causes\nprice to fall till demand and supply become equal to each other.\nOn the otherhand, at a very low price of ` 2, quantity demanded in 24 kg which\nis higher than quntity supplied of 16 kg. Since demand is higher then supply, price\nof the commodity increases to ` 3. At ` 3, the quantity demanded is 22 kg which\nis still higher than the quantity supplied of 18 kg. This further results in increase\nin price to ` 4 where we find that quantity demanded and supplied have become\nequal at 20 kg.\nHence as long as quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied, the price of the\ncommodity keeps increasing till both demand and supply become equal to each\nother.\nNote that when demand exceeds supply, we call it excess demand that causes\nprice to rise till demand equals supply.\nIn the example, at ` 4, demand and supply of the commodity are equal and hence\nthere is no reason for the price to fluctuate from here. Hence ` 4 is the equilibrium\nmarket price. At this price 20 kg is equilibrium quantity.\nThe process of price determination has also been explained with the help of figure\n22.1.

If at a given price, the quantity demanded of a commodity exceeds its\nquantity supplied we have excess demand. For example, in the table 22.1, when\nprice is ` 2 per kg., demand is 24 kg. while supply is just 16 kg. So this is a situation\nof excess demand.\nProcess  of  Adjustment\nOne  very  interesting  and  important  feature  of  price  mechanism  is  that  any\ndisequilibrium is self-correcting. Thus if there is excess demand at any price, price\nwill move in such a way so as to bring equilibrium between demand and supply. In\nFig. 22.1, when price is ` 2, quantity demanded is 24 kg but quantity supplied is\njust 16 kg. So there is excess demand of 24 – 16 = 8 kg. In this situation, buyers\nrealize that some of them will have to go without the commodity as supply is less\nthan that of demand. So they compete to buy the product and in the process, offer\na higher price. So, effectively price moves from ` 2 to ` 3 per kg. At this relatively\nhigher price, demand contracts from 24 kg to 22 kg and supply expands from 16\nto 18 kg. So, the magnitude of excess demand has diminished from 8 kg to 4 kg,\nbut  still  there  is  a  gap  and  some  of  the  buyers  have  still  to  go  without  the\ncommodity. So there is still competition, which raises the price further to ` 4 per\nkg, where demand contracts further to 20 kg and supply expands to 20 kg. Now,\nboth quantity demanded and quantity supplied are equal."

For example, in the table 22.1, when\nprice is ` 6 per kg., demand is 16 kg. while supply is just 24 kg., obviously this is\na situation of excess Supply.\nProcess  of  Adjustment\nWhen quantity supplied is more than quantity demanded at price of ` 6 per kg., the\nsuppliers are now worried as they know that because of excess supply, all of their\ngoods might not be sold. Every supplier now wants to ensure that his goods are\nnot left unsold. In a bid to ensure this, the supplier, tries to lure consumers by\nlowering the price to ` 5 per kg. But other suppliers are also doing precisely the\nsame. So, the price effectively falls to ` 5 per kg. But even at this relatively lower\nprice, supply still exceeds demand by 4 kg. and so another cycle of offering a lower"

For example, formation\nof policies regarding floor price and ceiling price can be explained with the help\nof equilibrium price.\n(a)   Ceiling price: When the price prevailing\nin the market is too high and is affecting\nthe interests of the consumers adversely,\nthe government has to step in and decide\nceiling price. The sellers are not allowed\nto raise price of their products beyond\nthis ceiling price and thus the interests of\nthe consumers are protected. An example\nof  this  may  be  rent  control  policy.\nSuppose the current rent for a particular\ntype of flats is determined at OP which is\nexorbitant. In such a case, the government can fix the rent arbitrarily at OPc\nwhich is lower then OP and will give some relief to tenants (consumers). It\nmay  be  mentioned  that  at  this  controlled  rent  OPc,  the  demand  for  flats\n(OQ\nDC\n) exceeds supply of flats (OQ\nSC\n) and this may lead to unscrupulous\npractices for which the government may have to take preventive and remedial\nmeasures. It may also be mentioned that fixation of price at a level above OP\nhas no point as price mechanism will automatically push the price level back\nto OP."

It remains at 10\nwhatever quantity is sold. Now when quantity is 1, TR = 10 × 1 = 10. When quantity\nincrease to 2, TR = 10 × 2 = 20. When quantity further increases to 3 and 4, TR\nincreases to 30 and 40 respectively. This shows that under perfect competition, the\ntotal revenue of a firm increases due to increase in quantity given the price of the\ncommodity in the market. Similarly, in the reverse way, if quantity falls from 4 to\n3 TR decreases from 40 to 30 and so on.\nAnother point to be learnt about TR is that, it increases at a constant rate. Starting\nfrom 10, TR increases to 20, 30, 40 at a constant rate of 10 given  the price and\nincrease in each unit of quantity.\nComing to AR, since AR = \nTR\nQ\nor price, you may club them as a single column in\nthe table instead of showing them separately. We have only given them in this table\nfor the purpose of calculating AR and to show that it is same as price.\nIn the table, you can see that MR is also 10 at each point. In the beginning, MR is\nshown as 10 and TR = 10. It means that TR has increased form 0 to 10 when\nquantity  has  increased  from  0  to  1.  When  quantity  increases  from  1  to  2,  TR\nincrease from 10 to 20. So 'TR = 20 – 10 = 10 = 10 and 'Q = 2 – 1 = 1. So MR\nat  the  2nd  quantity  or  2nd  unit  of  the  commodity  is  given  as  \nTR\nQ\n'\n'\n=\n20   1010\n10.\n211\n\u0010\n  \n\u0010\n Similarly when  quantity increases from 2 to 3, TR increases\nfrom 20 to 30. So MR at 3rd unit of the good is given as \n30    2010\n10.\n321\n\u0010\n  \n\u0010\n and\nso on. MR shows the manner is which TR is increasing as a result of one unit\nincrease in the quantity of the good. So MR in measured between two quantities.\nRelationship between AR and MR and TR\nFrom the table above we can easily state the relationship between AR, MR and TR\nof the firm under perfect competition as follows.\n1.Since price or AR is given under perfect competition and is constant through\nout, AR and MR are always equal. i.e. AR = MR for competitive firm.\n2.Between MR and TR, it can be said that MR is the rate of change of TR. In\nother words, the value of MR at any quantity gives the value at which TR has\nincreased above its previous unit."

This means total revenue is greater that total cost. In order words\nif the difference between total revenue and total cost is positive or greater than\nzero, then we can say that the firm is earning super normal profit.\nExample: A firm sells 5 units of a good at price 10. Its total cost of production is\n40. Does supernormal profit exist, and how much?\nAns:TR  = 5 × 10 = 50\nTC  = 40\nTR – TC  = 50 – 40 = 10\nSince 10 > 0 i.e. TR – TC is positive, there is super normal profit which is equal\nto 10.\nIf we want to find out whether super normal profit exists at each unit of the output\nor at each quantity of the output then we must compare revenue and cost at each\nquantity.\nYou know that revenue per unit of the good is called average revenue (AR).\nSimilarly, cost per unit of the good is called average cost (AC). If AR – AC is\npositive or AR > AC then there will be super normal profit. You can use price\ninstead of AR also."

In a situation of loss the firm is not\nable to recover its cost of production after selling the product.\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 23.2\n1.   The average cost of a firm is 10. It sold 10 units at a price of 10. What type of\nprofit did the firm earn?\n2.   If TR > TC, then there is normal profit. True of false\n3.   If TR = TC, then there is super normal profit. True or false.\n4.   If AR < AC, then there is loss. True or false\n23.3  PROFIT MAXIMIZATION OF A COMPETITIVE FIRM\nThe major objective of a firm is to maximize profit. To attain this we can explain\ntwo different approaches.\n1.   TR and TC approach\n2.   MR and MC approach\nTR and TC approach\nAs we know that profit is the difference between total revenue and total cost, profit\nmaximization  through  this  approach  states  that  the  firm  should  produce  that\nquantity of output at which the difference between total revenue and total cost is\nthe maximum (TR – TC is maximum).\nThis can be explained by using the following table.

On the otherhand TC of the firm is 15 even if Q\n= 0. This is because of presence of fixed cost as already told in the lesson on cost.\nTC  slowly increases in the beginning and then increases fast with increase in\nquantity of output. At Q = 1, TC = 15, then at Q = 2, TC = 20 which is an increase\nof 5. When Q = 3, TC = 22 which is an increase of 2 i.e. less than the previous unit.\nAfter this TC increases faster which you can easily verify.\nNow look at the column on profit, marked as TR – TC. At Q = 1, TR –TC = – 5.\nThis means that there is loss at this level of output because TC > TR. So the firm\nmust increase output. At Q = 2, TR = TC so that TR – TC = 0. Here the firm is able\nto recover the cost. At Q = 3, TR = TC = 8 and at Q = 4, TR –TC = 15. At Q =\n5, TR – TC = 10 which has fallen from the previous level of 15. At Q = 6,  TR –\nTC falls to 0 and then at Q = 7, TR – TC is again negative at – 15 indicating loss.\nFrom this it is clear that at Q = 4, TR – TC is maximum at 15.

Marginal revenue (MR) is constant\nat 5 since the firm is under perfect competition (already told in the section on\nrevenue). The marginal cost (MC) starts at 8 and then falls and increases to 5 and\ncontinues falling to 4 at Q = 5. After that MC rises to 5 at Q = 6 and then further\nrises to 7 at Q = 7.\nFrom the behaviour of MR and MC, you can see that initially between Q = 0 to 1,\nMC > MR. As MC = 8 and MR = 5. At Q = 1, MC = MR = 5. Then between Q =\n2 to Q = 6 MC lies below MR. Then again at Q = 6, MC rises to be equal to MR\nat 5. We can say that initially when MC > MR  there is loss. So the firm must increase\noutput. Then when MC = MR at Q = 2 there was no profit and no loss. But after\nthat between Q = 3 to Q = 5, MC lies below MR. This is the zone of profit. For\nexample at Q = 3, MR – MC = 5 – 2 = 3. At Q = 4, MR – MC = 5 – 3 = 2. At Q\n= 5, MR – MC = 5 – 4 = 1. At Q = 6, MR – MC = 5 – 5 = 0. i.e. We can say that\nprofit starts at from 0 at Q = 2 to 3 at Q = 3, 2 at Q = 4, 1 at Q = 5 and 0 at Q =\n6. Adding all these we get total profit to be 0 + 3 + 2 + 1+ 0 = 6, when Q = 6. After\nthat at Q = 7, there is loss again. So profit is maximized at Q = 6. In the table it is\nclearly shown that MR = MC at two points, one when Q = 2 and then when Q =\n6. However at Q = 2, profit was not maximum as the firm had loss earlier at Q =\n1 with MC more than MR at the time. But at Q = 6, MC = MR, but total profit is\nalready maximum as indicated by the fact that MC was less than MR when they\nbecome equal. Also after that MC exceeds MR creating loss.

It consists of two\nwords national and income. Each of these words has specific meaning in economics.\nIn this lesson, you will learn about the meaning of income, national income, and\nsome basic concepts of national income.

We receive wages and\nsalaries from our employers. We receive interest on capital for lending money. We\nalso receive gifts and donations from others without giving anything in return. All\nthese incomes can be grouped into two types of incomes.\n(A)  Factor incomes\n(B)  Non-factor incomes\n(A)  Factor incomes\nA factor income is the income accruing to a factor of production in return for the\nservices rendered to the production unit. We know that production is result of the\njoint efforts of the four factors of production. These four factors of production are:\n(i)  Labour\nLabour  includes  all  physical  and  mental  efforts  of  human  beings  used  for\nproduction of goods and services. These physical and mental efforts are inseparable.\nA worker requires both. Some of the jobs requires more of physical labour than\nmental labour and some jobs require more mental labour than physical labour.\nThe remuneration paid to the workers is popularly termed as wages and salaries.\nIn national income accounting, it is termed as compensation of employees.\n(ii)  Land\nBy land in economics we mean all that is given to us free by nature, on, below or\nabove the surface of the earth. On the surface it includes, surface area of the soil,\nwater, forests etc. below the surface it includes mineral deposits, water streams,\npetroleum etc., and above the surface it includes the sun, light, wind etc.\nAs the land became scarce, sale and purchase of land started.\nThose who owned land started charging price for the use of land. Such a payment\nto the land owner/landlord is termed as rent."

Unless somebody takes this initiative, no business can be\nstarted. The one who takes this initiative is termed as entrepreneur.\nThe income accruing to the entrepreneur is termed as profit.\nThus compensation of employees, rent, interest and profit are factor incomes of\nthe factor owners.\n(B)  Non- factor incomes:\nThere are certain money receipts which do not involve any sacrifice on the part of\ntheir recipients, the examples are gifts, donation charities, taxes, fines etc. No\nproduction activity is involved in getting these incomes. These income are called\ntransfer incomes because such income merely represent transfer of money without\nany good or service being provided in return for the receipts. These incomes are\nnot included in national income.\n24.2  BASIC ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES\nProduction consumption and investment are three basis economic activities that\ntake place in every economy\n(a)  Production\nProduction  is  addition  of  value  to  an  existing  commodity.  During  production\nprocess already existing commodities are made more useful by combined efforts\nof factors of production which increase their value. This increase in value is known\nas production. Suppose, a carpenter purchase wood worth ` 1000/- and makes\nfurniture from it sells it for ` 2000/- In this production process he has added value\nof ` 1000/- (` 2000-1000)\n(b)  Consumption\nUsing up of produced goods and services for the direct satisfaction of individual"

It includes all goods and\nservices purchased by households like food items, clothes shoes etc. and by the\ngovernment for collective consumption like, roads, bridges, parks, schools etc.\nInvestment/Capital Formation\nInvestment is that part of production which is left after consumption and used for\ncreating physical assets like machines, equipments, material etc. It is that part of\nproduction which is used for further production. It increases the future production\ncapacity of the economy.\nThe three activities of production, consumption and investment are interrelated\nand  interdependent.  Increase  in  production,  increases  both  consumption  and\ninvestment. Increase in consumption induces the producers to produce more in\nfuture. Increase in investment increases the future production capacity of a country\nwhich increases both production and investment. With out production there can\nbe  neither  consumption  nor  investment.  These  three  economic  activities  are\nresponsible for generating the income flows in the economy.\n24.3  CLOSED ECONOMY VS OPEN ECONOMY\nIn modern age, nearby every country has some economic relations with other\ncountries. All the countries buy goods and services from other countries. Borrowing\nand lending also takes place among different countries. The people of one country\nalso visit other countries. If the two countries have economic relations with each\nother, the real and money flows also take place between them.\nAn open economy is a term used for a country which has economic relations with\nthe rest of the world. Most of the countries of the world are open economies. The\nclosed economy is the term used for a country which has no economic relations\nwith the rest of the world. Such economies are rare in the present day world.\n24.4  STOCK AND FLOW\nThe distinction between stock and flows is very significant for national income\nestimates.\nStock: A stock is a quantity which is measured at point of time i.e. at 4 p.m. on 31st\nMarch etc. wealth, population, money supply etc. are stock concepts. It has no\ntime dimension.\nFlow: A flows is a quantity which is measured over a period of time i.e. days,\nmonth, years etc. It has time dimension. National income, population growth are\nflow concepts."

In carrying out these economic activities, people make transactions\nbetween different sectors of the economy. Because of these transactions, income\nand expenditure move in circular form. This is called circular flow of income. It is\nbased on two principles.\n(i)    The expenditure of the buyer because the income of the sellers.\n(ii)Good and services flow in one direction from sellers the buyers while money\npayment for these goods, and services flow in opposite direction i.e. from\nbuyers to sellers.\nIn this way, the flow of goods and services (real flow) and flow of money payments\n(money flow) together make a circular flow.\nReal flow\nHouseholds  render  factor  services  as  owners  of  land,  labour,  capital  and\nentrepreneurship  to  firms.  The  firms  produce  good,  and  services  to  meet  the\ndemand of the households. Such flow of factor services from households to firms\nand flow of goods and services from firms to households is know as real flow.\nMoney flow\nIn modern economies, goods and services and factor services are valued is terms\nof money. Households receive rent for land, wages for labour, interest for capital\nand profit for entrepreneurship- from firms and make payment for goods and\nservices supplies by firms.

A normal\nresident  is  a  person  who  ordinarily  resides  in  a  country  and  whose  centre  of\neconomic interest also lies in that particular country. Normal residents include both\nnationals (such as Indians living in India) and foreigners (non-nationals living in\nIndia).  For  example,  Nepalese  living  in  India  for  more  than  one  year  and\nperforming economic activities of production, consumption and investment in\nIndia, will be treated as normal residents of India.\nOn the contrary, Indian citizens, living abroad (say in USA) for more than one year\nand performing their basic economic activities there, will be treated as normal\nresident of that country where they normally reside. They will be considered as\nnon-residents of India (NRIs).\n24.9  INTERMEDIATE GOODS AND FINAL GOODS\nTo  understand  the  concept  of  national  income  and  its  related  aggregates  it  is\nnecessary to understand the meaning and difference between intermediate goods\nand final goods.\n(i) Intermediate Goods : Intermediate goods are those goods which are meant\neither for reprocessing or for resale. Goods used in the production process during\nan accounting year are known as intermediate goods. These are non-durable goods\nand services used by the producers such as raw materials, oil, electricity, coal, fuel\netc.  and  services  of  hired  engineers  and  technicians  etc.  Goods  which  are\npurchased for resale are also treated as intermediate goods. For example, Rice,\nwheat, sugar etc. purchased by a retailer/wholeseller.\n(ii) Final Goods : Goods which are used either for final consumption by the\nconsumers or for investment by the producers are known as final goods. These\ngoods do not pass through production process and are not used for resale. For\nexample, bread, butter, biscuits etc. used by the consumer.\nWhether a good is a final good or an intermediate good depends on its use. For\nexample; milk used by a sweet maker is an intermediate good but when it is used\nby the consumer it becomes a final good.\nIntermediate goods are not included in the calculation of national income. Only\nfinal goods are included in the calculation of national income because value of\nintermediate goods is included in the value of final .goods. If it is included in\nnational income it will lead to the problem of double counting."

Various firms and production units\nproduce different types of-goods. Money value of all goods and services produced\nis  known  as  value  of  output.  (It  means  value  of  output  includes  value  of\nintermediate goods also).\nThus;\nValue of output = Quantity × Price\nProducing units sell their output in the market. However, it is not necessary that\nthe whole of the output produced during an accounting year is sold during that very\nyear. Therefore, the unsold produce forms a part or the stock or inventories. So,\nchange in stock or inventories is also a part of value of output. Thus, value of\noutput can also be measured as\nValue of output = Sales + change in stock\nIt is clear that value of output includes value of intermediate consumption also.\nNational income does not include intermediate consumption expenditure. So for\ncalculation of National Income it must be deducted from value of output to avoid\nthe problem of double counting.\n(ii) Value Added : After deducting value of intermediate goods from value of\noutput we get value added. So, value added is the difference between value of\noutput and intermediate consumption expenditure.\nValue Added = Value of output - Intermediate Consumption Expenditure\nThe concept of value of output and Value Added can be explained with the help\nof an example. Suppose a farmer produces cotton worth ` 500 and sells it to the\ncloth mill. The cloth mill produces cloth worth ` 1,500. (Say produces 300 metres\nof cloth and market price of cloth is ` 5 per metre). But in this value, value of cotton\nis~ also included and cotton used by cloth mill is an intermediate good so value of\ncotton i.e. ` 500 will be intermediate cost. Therefore value added will be ` 1000/-\n``\n``\n` 1500 – \n``\n``\n` 500 = \n``\n``\n` 1,000/-\nGross and Net Measure :\n The concept of ‘Gross’ and ‘Net Measure’ is very\nimportant for the calculation of national income. The value of output and value\nadded calculated above is a gross measure because when goods are sold out in the\nmarket these include all type of costs. During production process fixed capital\nassets like machines, building etc. get depreciated and their value goes down. This"

So every production unit makes provision for depreciation. When it\nis included in value, of output and value added, these are called Gross Value of\noutput and Gross Value added respectively.\nIf depreciation is not included in value of output and value added these are called\nNet Value of output and net value added respectively.\nNet Value of output = Gross Value of output – depreciation\nNot Value of added = Gross Value of added – Depreciation\n24.11  MARKET PRICE AND FACTOR COST\nThe buyers purchase goods from the market and the price paid by them is known\nas ‘market price’: The sellers pay a part of this price as ‘indirect taxes’ to the\nGovernment.\n(i)    Indirect taxes are those taxes which are levied by the government on sales\nand production and also on imports of the commodities in the form of sales\ntax, excise duties, custom duties etc. These taxes increase the market price of\nthe commodities.\n(ii)   Subsides : Sometimes, Government gives financial help to the production\nunits for selling their product at lower prices fixed by the government. Such\nhelp is given in case of those selected commodities whose production the\nGovernment wants to encourage. If we deduct these subsidies from indirect\ntaxes, we get net indirect taxes.\n(iii) Net Indirect Taxes : It is the difference between indirect tax and subsidy.\nNet Indirect Tax = Indirect Tax - Subsidy\nValue Added at Market Price - Net Indirect Tax (NIT)\n= Value Added at Factor cost (FC)\nOrValue Added at MP - Indirect Tax + Subsidy\n= Value Added at FC\n24.12  DOMESTIC INCOME VS NATIONAL INCOME\nThe sum total of value added by all production units within domestic territory of\na country is called domestic product. Both residents and non-residents render\nfactor services to these units. Therefore, the income generated in these units is\nshared  by  both  the  residents  and  non-residents  as  their  factor  income.

These factor payments are known as factor payments made to the rest\nof the world.\nThe residents, in addition to their factor services to the production units located\nin  the  economic  territory  of  a  country,  also  provide  factor  services  to  the\nproduction  units  outside  the  economic  territory  i.e.,  to  the  rest  of  the  world\n(ROW). In return for these services they receive factor incomes from the rest of\nthe world.\nThus, National income is the sum total of factor incomes earned by the normal\nresidents of a country within and outside the economic territory. Therefore,\nNational Income = Domestic Income + Factor income received from ROW –\nFactor payments made to ROW.\nNet Factor Income from ROW : It is the difference between factor income 's\nreceived from ROW and factor payments made to ROW.\nNational Income/Product =Domestic Income/product + Net factor income\nform abroad\nAccordingly,\n(i)    Gross Domestic Product at market price + Net factor income from abroad =\nGross National Product at market price.\n(ii)Net Domestic Product at market price + Net factor income from abroad = Net\nNational Product at market price.\n(iii)Net Domestic Product at Factor cost + Net factor income from abroad = Net\nNational Product at factor cost.\nIt is Net National Product at factor cost which is called National Income of a\ncountry.\nNominal and Real GDP\nWhen the money value of goods and services included in GDP is estimated on the\nprices of current year, it is called GDP at current prices or nominal GDP. Here\ncurrent prices mean the prices of the year of which GDP is estimated. For example,\nfor estimating GDP for the year 2012-13 if we use the prices prevailing in the year\n2012-13, we shall get nominal GDP.\nOn the other hand, when the value of goods and services included in GDP is\nestimated on the prices of base year, we get GDP at constant prices or real GDP.\nIncrease in real GDP implies increase in the production of goods and services.\nTherefore, the calculation of GDP at constant prices or real GDP gives us the\ncorrect picture of the economic performance of an economy."

For example, a small\nshopkeeper starts his business in his own house employing his own labour and\ncapital. Hence, the income of this small shopkeeper will be termed as mixed income\nof self employed.\nNational Income as aggregate of factor incomes\nNational Income = Compensation of employes + Rent + Interest + profit + Mixed\nincome + Net factor income from ROW.\nor National Income = NDP at FC + Net Factor income from ROW.\n24.10  NATIONAL INCOME AS AGGREGATE OF FINAL\nEXPENDITURE\nIncome generated during production process in the form of factor incomes is spent\nby the factor owners on final consumption and investment goods. All consumer\ngoods are generally final goods. Durable producer’s goods like machines and\nbuildings which are used again and again in the production process are also final\ngoods because they are not further sold.\nDemand for final goods are made by all the three sections of the economy, namely\nhouseholds, firms and the government. The purchases for final consumption are\nmade by the households and the government. The purchases for investment are\nmade by the production units within the economic territory. Accordingly, the final\nexpenditure is classified into\n(a)   Private final consumption expenditure\n(b)   Government final consumption expenditure\n(c)   Investment Expenditure\n(d)   Net exports.\n(a) Private Final Consumption Expenditure\nPrivate Final Consumption Expenditure includes purchases by the households and\nthe non-profit institutions serving housholds.

For  this  they  employ  four\nfactors of  productions viz, land, labour, Capital and entrepreneurship. These four\nfactors of production jointly produce goods and services i.e. they add value to the\nexisting goods. This value added i.e. net domestic product is distributed among the\nowners of four factors of production receive rent, compensation of employees,\ninterest and profit for their contribution to the production of goods and services.\nThe incomes received by the owners of the factors of production are spent on the\npurchase  of  goods  and  services  from  the  production  units  for  the  purpose  of\nconsumption and investment. In short, production generates income. Income is\nused for expenditure, and expenditure, in turn, leads to further production. There\nare three phases of circular flow of national income. So there are three methods\nof measuring national Income. They are\n(A)  Output or value added method\n(B)  Income method\n(C)  Expenditure Method.\nProduction\nExpenditure\nIncome\nFig. 25.1: Three phases in the circular flow of national income."

At\nproduction level national income is the value of final goods and services produced\nin a country within the domestic territory plus net factor income from rest of the\nworld. In this method following steps are involved:\nFirstly, all the producing enterprises in an economy are broadly classified into\nthree industrial sectors according to their activities. These are:\nPrimary  sector:  Primary  sector  consists  of  those  producing  units  which  are\ncarried  out  by  using  natural  resources.  It  includes  productive  activities  like\nagriculture, forestry, fishing mining etc.\nSecondary sector: This sector includes those producing units which transform\ninputs into output for example: transformation of wood into a chair. It includes sub\nsectors like construction, manufacturing, electricity, gas and water supply.\nTertiary sector: Producing units of this sector produce services of all kinds such\nas banking, trade, transport etc. This is also known as service sector. This sector\nincludes transportation, communication, banking services etc.\nSecondly: Net value added of each producing unit of the economy is estimated\nfrom their gross value of out put which is calculated by multiplying total volume\nof  goods  produced  with  their  prices.  After  deducting  the  sum  of  value  of\nintermediate goods (IG), depreciation and net indirect taxes (NIT) from value of\noutput we get net value added at FC of the producing units. or\nNet value added at FC = Gross value of output - IC - Dep - NIT\nBy adding up net value added at FC of all the producing units of a sector we get\nnet value added at FC of that particular sector. The sum total of net value added\nat FC of all the three sectors in the domestic territory of a country gives us Net\nDomestic Product at Factor Cost.\nThirdly: Net National Product at factor cost is obtained by adding net factor\nincome from ROW to net domestic product at factor cost.\nIf net factor income from ROW is negative, NDP at FC will be greater than net\nnational product at factor cost (National Income), and if it is positive national\nincome will be greater than NDP at FC."

It should be noted that ‘capital formation’\ncan be referred to as saving or investment depending on the context in which the\nterm is being used.

When the total income of the economy increases total consumption of\nthe economy will also increases. In the same way, it can also be said that economy\nwith higher level of national income consumes more than the economy which has\nlower level of national income.\nExample 1: In India the household finall consumption expenditure as percentage\nof GDP increased from 59 per cent in 2011 to 60 percent in 2012 with increase in\nGDP. In USA, which is a developed economy the share of household consumption\nexpenditure in its GDP is 69 percent in 2012 which was higher than that of India.\nThe  relationship  between  consumption  and  the  level  of  income  in  called\nconsumption  function.  Consumption  function  tells  that  consumption  is  a\nfunction of income, or in other words, consumption depends on the level of\nincome.\nIf  should  be  noted  here  that,  when  we  talk  about  income,  we  normally  mean\ndisposable  income.  Disposable  income  is  that  part  of  total  income  which  is\navailable for consumption and saving. To elaborate it further, note that when a\nperson receives income in return of factor services rendered by him/her, he/she\nmay not spend all the income on consumption only. There are certain compulsory\npayments  he/she  has  to  make  out  of  the  income  received,  such  as  tax  to  the\ngovernment, fines if any etc. As a result the income available for consumption\nneeds is reduced. Disposable income is defined as the income remained after\npayment of tax and fines etc. If tax payment in high, disposable income will be\nlower and vice versa. Accordingly, the level of consumption will be affected.\nIt should be noted that disposable income and total income will be same if tax\npayment and fine are not existing or zero.\nExample 2: Individual A receives an income of Rs 10,000. He paid income tax at\na rate of 2 percent. What is his disposable income?\nAns: 2 % of 10,000 =  tax paid = 200\nHence disposable income = 10000–200 = Rs. 9,800.\nExample 3: Individual B receives an income of Rs 5000. He has not paid any tax.\nWhat in his disposable income?\nAns: Since tax paid = 0, disposable income is same as total income, i.e.\n5000 – 0 = Rs 5000.\nIn this lesson we will treat income and disposable income as one and the same."

Under this we compare the figures\nof consumption and income in each time period. In order to establish the nature\nof relationship between them, two important calculations are made in this context.\nOne,  Average  propensity  to  consume  (APC)  and  two,  Marginal  propensity  to\nconsume (MPS).\nAPC (Average Propensity to Consume)\nAPC is defined as the ratio of consumption to income. This ratio in calculated to\nknow the proportion of income devoted for consumption purposes in the specific\nperiod of time for which data is given. So APC is calculated for each time period.\nLet consumption for any particular time is denoted as ‘C’. Let income of that\nperiod is denoted as Y. Then\nAPC = \nC\nY\nExample 4: If consumption is Rs 300 Cr. and income is Rs 600 crore, what is APC?\nWhat does this imply?\nAns: APC =\n3001\n0.5\n6002\n  \nThis implies that on an average 50 percent of the total income has been spent on\nconsumption.\nExample  5: In  the  country  X,  70  percent  of  the  income  has  been  devoted  to\nconsumption. If income is Rs1000 crore, find out consumption?\nAns: Consumption = \n70\n1000    700\n100\nu \nConsumption = Rs 700 crore.\nHint: Here APC = 70 percent, Y = 1000\nsince APC = \nC\nY\n, C = APC × Y\nExample 6: In a country, consumption amount is Rs. 800 crore which is 80 percent\nof its total disposable income?

Symbolically,\nMPC < 1.\nSince MPC = \nC\nY\n'\n'\n, this implies that \nC\nY\n'\n'\n < 1.\nThis further implies that 'C < 'Y.\nPutting it  in words, it can be said that increase in consumption is less than the\ncorresponding increase in income.

It is\ncommonly observed that people do not consume the entire part of increase in their\nincome. They, certainly increase the amount of consumption with increase income\nas they get a scope to increase their level of satisfaction. But, at the same time, they\ndo wish to save a part of the increase in income for future needs. Saving a part of\nincome for future reflects a sense of security which is psychological in nature.\nSo increase in income is divided between increase in consumption and increase in\nsaving. Symbolically, we can write that\n'Y = 'C + 'S.\ni.e. increase in  income = increase in consumption + increase in saving. From this\nit is clear that 'C is less than 'Y. So MPC or in less than one.\nINTEXT QUESTION 26.1\n1.   Consumption depends on (a) saving, (b) disposable income, (c) needs (d) none\nof the above\n2.   A person pays 20 percent of his income as tax.

He argued that short run\nis  more  important  because  people  are  more  concerned  about  their  immediate\nconsumption needs. He argued that even consumption depends on the level of\nincome, people still manage to consume the necessities needs to sustain oneself,\neven if there is no income for the time being. To explain this further, think that an"

Does it mean that he\nwill start consuming only after two months! No. He has to take food and wear\nclouses  which  are  bare  necessities  of  life.  He  has  to  purchase  these  either  by\nborrowing money or by arranging the money by selling some of his assets. He will\nrepay the loan or recover the asset after he gets his income after two months but\nas of now, he is having some consumption even if his income is zero for the time\nbeing.\nSimilarly in the economy, there are children and old people who do not have any\nincome but they consume by depending on others who are earning. For example\nin  a  family,  children  depend  on  their  working  parents  to  consume  goods  and\nservices. An old person depends on the income of his son or daughter or pension\nfrom the government to consume things he needs now.\nHence, at any point of time in the short run there is some fixed amount which the\npopulation  of  the  economy  spent  on  consumption  even  if  income  is  zero  or\nnothing. This part of consumption is called autonomous or fixed consumption. It\nis a constant and can take any numerical value. Let us denote this value as a.\nThe other part of consumption comes from the income and the manner in which\nit increases over time. Once people start getting their income, they use it to repay\nthe loans taken earlier, save for future and spend a fraction on consumption, over\nand above the fixed amount of consumption which they had already made earlier.\nThe additional consumption over and above the fixed consumption on necessary\nthings in influenced by the level of income received and MPC of the people. MPC\ncomes  into  picture  here  because  it  reflects  the  consumption  behaviour  of  the\npopulation out of their income.\nOn the basis of the above arguments as provided by Keynes, we can write the\nequation of consumption function in the following manner:\nConsumption = Some fixed amount plus MPC times the current level of income.\nSymbolically,\nC = a + MPC × Y\nwhereC =  Consumption\norY =  fixed consumption\n(Fixed consumption is also called Autonomons consumption i.e. COnsumption at\nZero level of Income)\nY =  Income (disposable Income)\nMPC =\nC\nY\n'\n'"

In other words what are the determinants\nof  propensity  to  consume  other  than  income?  Let  us  identify  some  important\nfactors as follows:\n(i) Rate of interest, (ii) Wealth (iii) Distribution of income (iv) consumer credit.\n(i) Rate of interest\nCommercial bank offer a certain rate of interest on the deposits held by public and\ncharges rate of interest on the loans given to public. When people donot want to\npurchase goods and services, they keep their money in the bank to earn rate of\ninterest. But when they want to buy goods and services, they with draw money\nfrom the bank and loose interest in the process. In this way rate of interest play an\nimportant role in influencing a person’s decision to consume now or in futrue.\nIt should also be noted here that, according to Keynes, rate of interest may not be\nan important factor in influencing consumption decision in a short run time period.\nUrgent and immediate consumption needs have to be satisfied without considering\nthe rate of interest factor. This happens because consumption is directly related to\nsatisfaction  of  wants  at  present  which  is  more  important  than  earning  rate  of\ninterest in future by deferring consumption today.\nFor investors and producers, however, rate of interest play an important role in\ntheir decision making regarding capital investment. To make investment producers\nneed loan from bank. If the rate of interest in high the cost of borrowing will be\nhigh. This may discourage them to invest as per their desire and or need. On the\notherhand, if the rate of interest is low, producers may be encouraged to invest\nmore.\n(ii) Wealth\nPropensity to consume is influenced by a person’s holding of wealth. People who\nhave wealth in the form of gold, jewellery, ownership of land and building, shares\nand  bonds  etc  enjoy  a  higher  level  of  income  generated  from  the  wealth,\nAccordingly their consumption level will be higher."

It is often observed and experienced that wage earners are exploited by the\npeople who own property and business and earn rent, interest and profit. As a result\nthere exist ineqality in income distribution leading to division of the society into\npoor and rich. It is obvious that rich people consume more than poor people.\nAccordingly the economy’s propensity to consume will be affected.\n(iv) Consumer credit\nFinally, availability of consumer credit influences consumption behaviour to a large\nextent in the economy. There are many durable goods which consumers want to\nbuy. But due to lack of credit facility, they are not able to buy them as they are costly\nitems. Items such as car, scooter, TV, refrigerator, washing machine etc. are costly\ndurable goods and also necessary for satisfaction of wants. Working people in\nurban area have got high demand for these goods.\nWith easy credit facility provided by banks, now people are buying these items in\nlarge quantities by paying easy instatments to the banks.\nSaving Function\nBoth consumption and saving form two parts of a person’s disposable income. The\nway consumption depends on the level of disposable income, saving also depends\non the same.\nSaving function gives the relationship between saving and income in the economy.\nSaving can be defined as that part of income (or disposable income) which is not\nconsumed. This follows from the psychological law of consumption stated earlier.\nLet us denote saving as S.\nIn order to calculate saving, use example 7 given earlier in this lesson. In that\nexample we had written that\nC = 500 + 0.5 Y. Taking Y as 2500 we calculated that (C = 1750).\nFrom  this  example  we  can  calculate  saving  by  deducting  consumption  from\nincome. That is\nS= Y – C\norS= 2500 – 1750 = 750."

Capital stock include fixed assets such as land, building,\nmachinery and equipment etc and change in stock.\nInvestment by firms can be expressed in two ways:\n(i) Gross investment and (ii) Net investment.\nGross investment is defined as sum of net investment and depreciation. Gross\ninvestment = net investment + Depreciation.\nIt should be mentioned that in order to produce goods and services in the economy\nfor the purpose of consumption, producers or firms need to invest in machinery,\nequipment, land, building etc and stock of raw material and finished goods. Also\ndue to normal wear and tear, these items loose their value over time period. Hence\na producer must spend on depreciation charges against wear and fear of machinery.\nThe difference between gross and net investment is called depreciation. We can\nwrite\nGross investment – Net investment = Depreciation.\nNature of investment\nIn macro economics investment can be categorised as autonomous and induced.\nAutonomous investment is that part of investment which is fixed and most needed\nto carry out production activity. It is independent of the level of income or value\nof output generated in the production process. Expenditure on land, building or\nmachineries needed for production can be treated as constant or fixed as they are\nrequired  to  start  production.  It  can  be  also  treated  in  the  same  way  as  fixed\nconsumption told earlier.\nSymbolically autonomous investment can be written as\nI = I\n0\nwhereI = investment\nI\n0\n = Autonomous investment which is constant.\nFor  example,  let  a  firm  wants  to  produce  garments.  For  this  the  minimum\nrequirement  is  a  room  and  sewing  machine.  Whatever  the  level  of  output  or\nincome, expenditure on purchasing a room and sewing machine will be taken as\nautonomous  investment.  Say  this  amount  is  Rs.  20,000.  Then  autonomous\ninvestment is Rs 20,000.\nThe diagram for autonomous investment is given as a horizontal line as given\nbelow in Fig. 26.4."

It  must  be  noted  that  the\neconomy’s  total  product  is  used  for  final  consumption  as  well  as  for  further\nproduction. Accordingly, we can identify the following consuming sectors\n1.   Household\n2.   Firm\n3.   Government\n4.   Rest of the world\nAggregate demand consists of the demand for goods and services by theses sectors\ntaken together.\nLet us discuss these components of aggregate demand separately.\n1. Household Consumption Demand\nThe household sector of the economy consists of individuals and families and non-\nprofit organization who serve the households. These entities consume final goods\nand  services  for  satisfaction  of  wants.  Individuals  and  families  demand  both\ndurable and non-durable goods. Examples of durable goods are, T.V., Refrigerator,\nWashing machine, Car, Scooter. Motorbike, Furniture, etc. Non-durable goods\ninclude food and non-food items. Cereals, pulses, vegetables, fruits etc. are food\nitems whereas cloth, shoes, cosmetics , fuel. etc. are part of non-food items . All\nthese goods are demanded by the households.\nThe non-profit organizations serving the household  sector include charitable\ntrusts, religious foundations etc., who demand goods and services to serve the\nhousehold sector. They do not do business to earn profit. For example, a  trust to\nserve the differently abled people demand various goods such as office stationeries,\nfurniture.  Vehicle  etc.  Such  consumption  is  a  part  of  household  consumption\ndemand."

Producers or Firm's Investment Demand\nThe firms and or the producers demand goods and services for further production.\nThe demand for goods by the firms to produce a product is known as “Investment”.\nFirms demand capital goods such as machinery and equipment. They also demand\nintermediate goods for further production. Purchase of wheat floor to produce\nbread by a bakery unit is an example of intermediate good or Secondary Inputs.\nWater, electricity, raw materials etc used for product in one examples of intermediate\nconsumption.\n3. Government Expenditure\nThe  Government  constitutes  an  important  sector  which  purchases  goods  and\nservices for the benefit of public. So, all purchases made by the government are\nintermediate purchases. The Government provides services such as law and order,\ndefence,  education  and  health  etc.  To  provide  these  service,  the  government\nfunctions through various ministries and departments. To maintain these offices.\nThe government purchases uniforms, vehicles, stationary, furniture etc. It spends\nmoney on payment of salaries to its employees. In this way, government expenditure\nconstitutes a sizeable part of the aggregate demand.\n4. Purchases by Rest of the World\nWe are living in the era of globalization where in countries are linked to each other\nthrough  trade  and  transfers.  A  country  which  has  got  economic  relation  with\nanother  country  is  called  an  open  economy.  In  an  open  economy,  the  foreign\ncountries, which have economic relationship with the domestic country constitute\nthe rest of the world. The way the households of the domestic country demand\ngoods and services inside the country, in the same way the foreigners also purchase\ngoods and services from the country from outside. This is called import of the rest\nof the world or export of the domestic country. However, since the households,\nfirms and government of the domestic country also purchase goods and services\nfrom  abroad  which  are  called  imports  from  rest  of  the  world.  Net  export  is\ncalculated by deducting the imports of domestic country from abroad from its\nexports to rest of the world. Exports minus imports are called net exports . Net\nexport is the measure of demand for goods and services by the rest of the world\nin the domestic Country.\nNow we can write that aggregate demand is the sum of demands by households\nfirms, and government and rest of the world. Let us express household demand as\nconsumption, firms' demand as investment, government demand as government\npurchases and demand of rest of the world as net exports. Then, we can say that\naggregate demand is the sum of consumption, investment, government purchases\nand net exports.\nWe can also write systematically :"

So  saving  and  investment  equilibrium  is  not  automatic  or\nnatural. It so happens that people plan to save certain amount but ends up in saving\ndifferent amount. In other worlds planned saving may be different from actual or\nrealised saving. The difference in planned and actual amount could be due to\nunexpected changes in prices in the market and changes expectations of households\netc. Similarly, firms may plan to invest certain amount in assets but may end up in\nprocuring asset which are different in value as planned earlier. This difference\narises due to increase or decrease in price of assets (machinery and equipment)\navailability of loan from banks etc. So planned and realized investments may or\nmay not always equal.

In other words effective\ndemand in the economy refers to the point where aggregate demand equals the\nlevel  of  output  in  the  short  run  given  the  price  level.

Differentiate between aggregate demand (AD) and Effective demand (ED) ?\n27.3  MULTIPLER AND ITS WORKING\nEvery economy wants to increase its level of equilibrium income every year . You\nknow that increase in income is a manifestation of economic growth which is\nnecessary to raise the standard of living of the population. To achieve this, the\neconomy must increase the level of investment. Increase in investment is expected\nto bring about multiple increase in income. This means that increase in income has\nto be more than increase in investment  In such a case, increase in income can be\nexpressed as the product of some numerical value greater than one and the increase\nin investment. So take an example, Let investment in the economy increases from\n100 crores to 150 crores, increase in investment  is 150-100 = 50 crores. Let us\nexpect that level of income increases by 100 crores. Since 100 = 2 × 50, it can be\nsaid that increase in income is equal to two times the increase in investment. Given\nthe  increase  of  investment  the  number  which  is  multiplied  with  it  is  called\nmultiplier. In this example multiplier is 2.\n27.3.1  Definition of Multiplier\nIn the above example we can say that the multiplier 2 which is derived by dividing\n100 crores by 50 crores. This mean \n100 crores\n2\n50 crores\n \nWe can put this symbolically. Here 100 crores is the increase in income . Denote\nit as 'Y. Denote 50 crores, which is increase in investment, as 'I. The multiplier\n2 can be denoted as k . Then we can write that"

Using this equaiton we can also write that\n'Y = k'I\nThis  implies  that  increse  in  income  is  equal  to  multiplier  times  increase  in\ninvestment. Here value of k holds key to increase in income given the value of\nincrease in investment.\nIf K = 1. Then 'Y = 'I\nThis means that increase in investment brings about same amount of increase in\nincome. If  k > I (k is greater than I) then, increase in investment will bring about\nhigher increase in income than itself. We always expect that multiplier should be\ngreater than 1, so that increase in income will be higher than that of investment\nwhich can be termed as profitable.\n27.3.2  Derivation of the Value of Multiplier\nIn the above example if value of multiplier becomes 3 then increase in income will\nbe 3 × 50 crores = 150 crores. If multiplier becomes 4, then increase in income will\nbe still higher at 4 × 50 crores = 200 crores. Higher value of multiplier is always\ndesirable. What determines the value of multiplier ? You know that firms make\ninvestments and give employment to produce goods and services and sell them in\nthe market. They expect that consumers should demand their product so that they\nget higher return which will result in higher level of income. This implies that\nconsumption demand is the important factor in influencing the level of income. As\nalready said in the lesson on consumption, saving and investment, consumption\ndemand  is  itself  influenced  by  marginal  prosperity  to  consume  (MPC)  out  of\nincome of the household consumers. So, higher the MPC, hither will be consumption\ndemand for goods and services produced by firms who have made investment to\nproduce them. Higher consumption will push the revenue or income of these firms\nupwards.  So,  multiplier  which  is  multiplied  by  the  increase  in  investment  is\ndetermined by MPC. Higher value of MPC will make multiplier higher and vice\nversa. It is also said earlier that MPC is written as 1-MPS. If the value of MPS is\nsmall, then MPC is large. Hence, multiplier is higher if MPC is higher or MPS is\nlower. Similarly if MPC is lower or MPS is higher, then multiplier will be lower.\nTo derive the value of multiplier involving MPC or MPS we can use the condition\nfor attaining the equilibrium income as follows:\nC + I = C +S\nSince,C + S = Y,"

But at the point\nof equilibrium AD = Y. So, income also increases by ` 100 crores in the first round\ni.e.\nThis also implies that 'AD = 'Y.\n'Y = 100 crore in the first round.\nIn the second round, consumption increases due to increase in income. Since MPC\n= 0.5 and 'Y = ` 100 crores\nIncrease in consumption or 'C = MPC ×'Y = 0.5 × 100 = ` 50 crores.\nAs a result of increase in consumption by ` 50 crores AD also increase by ` 50\ncrores as consumption is part of AD. But AD = Y at equilibrium, (so 'AD = 'Y,\nas said above). Hence in the second round increase in income is ` 50 crores.

What is total increase in income\nafter two rounds?\n27.4  EXCESS DEMAND\nYou  learnt  that  equilibrium  level  of  income  is  determined  at  the  point  where\naggregate demand (AD) equals the level of output (Y). Let us assume that the level\nof output is at the maximum possible level or potential level which is achieved by\nfull utilization of the resources of the economy. This means that the economy\noutput will not increase beyond the potential level. You also learnt that increase\nin AD through increase in investment , brings about increase in income. or output\ndue to working of multiplier. Now think of a situation in which the economy is\nalready operating at its potential level of output and there is increase in investment\nat that level. What will happen? Will the level of output increase further?\nThe  answer  is  that  the  economy’s  output  will  not  increase.  However  due  to\nincrease in investment, which is a type of fixed or autonomous expenditure, the\naggregate demand (AD) will increase and exceed the level of potential output.\nSuch a situation is called excess demand in the country.\nSo. excess demand refers to the situation when aggregate demand exceeds the\npotential level of output in the economy.\nThe result of excess demand is inflation in the economy. The reason is obvious.\nWhen people have more money to demand more goods and services while the\nsupply of output is less than this, then the price level will rise to balance the demand\nand supply forces.\nDiagrammatically excess demand is created when AD line shifts upwards at the\nlevel of equilibrium as shown in the diagram below.\nY\nAD\n0\nY\n0\nX\nOutput/Income\n45°\nE\nAD =C+I\n1\nAD (actual) = C+I\n2\nD\nExcess\ndemand\nFig. 27.5"

Let  the  economy  be  at\nequilibrium level of income. Now let aggregate demand increases from AD\n1\n to\nAD\n2\n due to increase in fixed investment or consumption. As a result a gap to the\nextent of DE is created which is the difference between the new and old aggregate\ndemand. Here the income is not increasing beyond Y\n0\n after increase in AD. So the\ngap DE is the measure of excess demand in the economy. This gap is also called\ninflationary gap.\n27.5  DEFICIENCY IN DEMAND\nDeficiency in demand is exactly opposite to excess demand situation. When the\neconomy is at its potential level and there is a fall in aggregate demand due to fall\nin autonomous consumption or investment, then it is called deficiency in demand.\nAt this situation the output level seems to be in surplus in the market and people\ndo not demand it thus putting pressure on price level to fall in order to balance the\ndemand and supply forces. This creates deflationary pressure in the economy\nwhere deflation implies fall in prices of goods and services.\nDiagrammatically, deficiency in demand is shown by the fall in AD line at the level\nof potential output as shown below in diagram.\nY\nAD\n0\nY\n0\nX\nOutput/Income\n45°\nE\nAD =C+I\n1\nAD (actual) = C+I\n2\nF\nDeficient\ndemand\nFig. 27.6\nIn  the  diagram,  equilibrium  income  is  determined  at  point  E  where  original\naggregate demand,  AD\n1\n cuts 45 degree line.

Inflation reduces the purchasing\npower of the people so that they are not able to purchase the quantity they want\ncausing reduction in their level of satisfaction. Poor and middle income group are\nworst affected by rise in the price level. Similarly, producers are worst affected by\nfall in prices or deflation. Their profit level falls due to fall in prices forcing them\nto reduce investment. This further causes employment level to fall. So the whole\nsociety gets badly affected by deflation.\nHence it is necessary to control inflation and deflation both. The measures or\npolicies, implemented by the government to tackle these problems include:\n(i)    Fiscal policy\n(ii)   Monetary policy.\n(i) Fiscal policy\nFiscal policy is the economic policy of the government that is concerned with (a)\ntaxation (b) public expenditure and (c) public borrowing. The government uses\nfiscal policy to control the rising prices or deal with the situation of deflation. In\ncase of inflation or excess demand situation the government can exempt the poor\npeople from paying income tax and reduce the burden of tax on the middle class\nby increasing the limit of income level to be exempted from income tax.\nAt the same time government can increase the tax burden on the rich class who are\ncapable  of  paying  higher  amount  of  tax.  In  case  of  tax  on  commodities,  the\ngovernment can tax the luxury items heavily, while reduce the taxes on necessary\nand normal goods extensively used by the population.\nAlong with taxation policy, the government must reduce public expenditure and\npublic borrowing to control excess demand. Reduction in public expenditure and\npublic borrowing reduces the supply of money thereby reducing inflation.\nIn case of deficiency in demand the government must increase its expenditure and\nborrowing  to  boost  the  economy.  Public  expenditure  include  expenditure  on\nwelfare of people, creation of infrastructure, investments to generate employment\nopportunities  etc.  For  this  government  can  borrow  money  to  finance  these\nschemes.\n(ii) Monetary policy\nThe monetary policy is implemented by the country’s centrol Bank. In case of\nIndia, it is the Reserve Bank (RBI) which implements monetary policy.\nMonetary policy refers to credit control measures used by the central bank to\nregulate and control the level of credit creation by commercial banks.

Monetary policy aims at controlling the excess or\ndeficiency in demand.\nThe following are the instruments of monetary policy.\n(i)    Bank rate\n(ii)Open market operation\n(iii)  Variable reserve ratio\nBank rate is the rate at which the central bank discounts the securities of the\ncommercial banks. It is also the rate at which commercial banks borrow money\nfrom the control bank. To check excess demand, the central bank increases the\nbank rate in order to control the borrowing capacity of the commercial banks so\nthat they do not indulge in distribution of loans to the customers. As a result credit\nsupply is checked. On the other hand, the central bank can decrease the bank rate\nto cure deflation.\nOpen market operation refers to buying and selling of securities by central bank.\nNormally the commercial banks are the buyers of such securities.\nDuring  inflation  (excess  demand  situation)  the  central  bank  sells  government\nsecurities to commercial banks in returns of money. As a result money supply in\nthe economy falls causing prices to fall. During deflation, the central bank will buy\nback the securities by paying money to the commercial banks thus causing money\nsupply to rise which cures deficiency in demand.\nCertain percentage of the value of the asset of the commercial bank is kept as\nreserves    in  the  central  bank  called  variable  reserve  ratio.  To  central  excess\ndemand,  the  central  bank  will  increase  the  variable  reserve  ratio.  So,  that\ncommercial banks have to a part with larger amount of their asset with the central\nbank. This will reduce their ability to supply more money in the society. To tackle\ndeflation, the central bank will decrease the variable reserve ratio which will have\nthe opposite effect.\n(Also see monetary policy in lesson 28).\nA major reason of excess demand in the economy is increase in credit supply by\nbanks in anticipation of creation of more output in future Increase in credit or\nmoney supply creates immediate increase in demand for goods and services and\nthus rise in prices. Similarly fall in credit or money supply creates deficiency in\ndemand as people do not have enough money to buy goods and services leading\nto fall in price."

Such a system was called\nbarter  system.  However  with  passage  of  time  the  barter  system  had  to  be\nabandoned because of its inherent problems. Some of the demerits of barter system\nare as follows:\n1.  Search  Cost\nA common problem of barter system was that, one had to spend a lot of time in\nsearching for the person who is willing to exchange the good at the given terms\nand conditions. In the early period of human civilization, this was a very difficult\ntask as there was no proper facility with regard to transport and communication.\n2.  Lack  of  double  coincidence  of  wants\nA  common  problem  with  the  barter  system  is  the  lack  of  double  coincidence\nofwants  which  means  that  if  one  wants  to  exchange  some  good  with  another\nperson then the latter must also be willing to exchange his/her good with the\nformer. For example, let a person wants cloth and he has stock of wheat with him\nto exchange for it. In such a case the person can exchange wheat for cloth with\nanother person who has cloth and who also wants wheat. In practical life, such\nsituation may or may not arise. If the person who has cloth does not want wheat,\nthen exchange of wheat for cloth will never take place and both the individuals\ncannot satisfy their wants. This is an example of lack of double coincidence of\nwants.  So  barter  system  will  work  when  there  is  double  coincident  of  wants,\notherwise it will not work.\n3.  Lack  of  division  of  goods\nCertain goods are not physically divisible into small pieces. Suppose, a person\npossesses a buffalo and he wants items, such as food grains. Then how much of\nbuffalo can be traded for food grains? It was very difficult to determine because,\na buffalo cannot be divided into several pieces.\n4.  Lack  of  common  unit  of  measurement\nUnder barter system, it was difficult to equate the values of different goods which\nwere traded because of lack of common unit of measurement.Taking the example\nin the previous paragraph, it will be verydifficult to determine the amount of buffalo\nrequired to trade for some specific amountof food grains. Also it sounds absurd.\nThis happens because a buffalo can never become a common measure of value.\nThis problem is same for all other goods."

Problem  of  Storage\nAnother problem of barter system is that a person must store a large volume of his\nown good in order to exchange for his/her desired goods with others on day to day\nbasis. Take the example of a farmer who has produced wheat. Obviously, he will\nuse some amount of wheat for his own consumption and keep some amount to get\nother necessary items by trading with others. If he wants furniture, then he will go\nto a carpenter who is willing to trade furniture in return of his wheat. Similarly, if\nhe wants cloth, then he has to trade with a weaver who is ready to give cloth by\nreceiving wheat and so on. So the farmer must construct a warehouse first to keep\na stock of his wheat in order to carry out the transactions at the time of need for\nhis desired good. But constructing and maintaining a warehouse was itself a very\ndifficult task in early days of civilization.\n6.  Loss  of  Value\nFinally, a major problem of barter system is that, a good looses its original quality\nand value if it is stored for a long period. Many goods, such as salt, vegetables etc.,\nare perishable. Hence, goods were never accepted for trading in future because\nthey could not be used as store of value. This also implies that no good could be\nused for the purpose of lending and borrowing.\nDue to above problems, the barter system could not continue for long. As human\ncivilization progressed, people realized that there has to be some common medium\nof exchange which can be easily carried, stored, and used to express the  value of\na good. So money came into being. Hence the need for money arose due to the\nfailure of bartersystem.\nINTEXT  QUESTIONS  28.1\n1.   Under barter system a good was exchanged for coins.(True or False)\n2.   Simran wants to have 6 pencils in exchange of a note book from Kavita. But\nKavita is not agreeing to this condition. The problem may be related to lack of\ndouble coincidence of wants.(True or False)\n3.   Ahmed took 10 kg of rice from Asghar last year as loan. Now he is willing to\nreturn the same. But Asghar is not accepting it. Give one possible reason for\nit.\n28.2  MEANING  OF  MONEY\nMoney  has  been  defined  differently  by  different  economists.  But  the  most\nacceptable definition of money can be stated in terms of all the functions of money.\nMoney is anything which is generally accepted as a means of exchange, a\nmeasure  and  store  of  value  and  which  also  acts  as  standard  of  deferred\npayments."

Broadly speaking\nthe functions of money may be classified into primary (basic) and secondary\nfunctions.\nPrimary  or  Basic  Functions:\n(i)    Medium of Exchange\nMoney acts as a medium of exchange of all goods and services. The use of\nmoney has greatly facilitated process of exchange by dividing it into two parts\ni.e. sale and purchase. It has removed the difficulty of double coincidence of\nwants found under the barter system. Therefore, in modern world we hardly\nfind  any  evidence  of  exchange  of  goods  and  services  without  the  use  of\nmoney.\nExample: You pay ` 10 to buy a pen. The seller receives ` 10 from you by\nselling the pen. So a pen is exchanged for ` 10.\n(ii)   Measure of Value\nMoney helps to measure value of goods and services in terms of price. The\nuse of money has completely removed the confusion regarding value of one\ngood/service  vis-a-vis  the  other.  This  function  has  greatly  facilitated  the\nprocess of exchange of different goods and services. The value of a good is\ndetermined by multiplying its price with the quantity purchased. Since the\nprice is expressed in monetary units, the value of a good is also expressed in\nmonetary terms.\nExample: Let price of rice be ` 20 per Kilogram. One bag full of rice weighs\n25 Kilograms. Then the value of the bag of rice is ` 20X25= ` 500\nSecondary  Functions:\n(i)    Store of Value or Wealth\nMoney is the most convenient and economical means to store wealth which\ndoes not lose its value so quickly over time. Thus, it is the most accepted\nmeans to store wealth or value. As medium of exchange you can pay money\nto buy goods. This means if you have money, you have the power to purchase\na good or a service. So money has purchasing power. The value of the good\nis contained in that purchasing power. Hence value of good is indirectly stored\nin money, you hold. Similarly, as a seller of good, you receive the money which\nmeans value of good you sold, comes back to you through money.\nExample: Harpreet sells furniture to a buyer for ` 2500.This means a value\nof ` 2500 was exchanged. The buyer, who purchased the furniture, has the"

Hence a value of` 2500 was stored\nin the money received by Harpreet as a seller. Harpreet could not have stored\nfurniture but she can definitely store money which in turn has stored the value\nof ` 2500.\n(ii)   Standard of Deferred Payments\nDeferred payments are those payments which are promised to be made in\nfuture. Money acts as a means of deferred payments mainly because it has\ngeneral acceptability. Its value remains relatively constant over time and it is\nmore durable as compared to other goods. In case of borrowing and lending\nactivities only money is normally acceptable to be paid at a future date. Goods\nloose their value over time and due to possibility of lack of double coincident\nof wants they are not acceptable to settle debts in future.\n(iii) Transfer of Value\nThis function of money is derived from the store of value function of money.\nMoney is used to transfer value from one place to another or from one person\nto another. As a traveller when you move from one place to another, you can\neasily carry money to make necessary transactions on the way and in your\ndestination place. You can also transfer the money through bank. Now people\ncarry ATM card and withdraw cash wherever the facility is available.\nOther  functions  of  Money\n(i)    Distribution of National Income\nIncome is generated by the factors of production engaged in the production\nprocess. The factors are land, labour, capital and entrepreneurship. For the\nsupply of these factor services to the production units, the supplier of labour\ngets wage, the supplier of land gets rent, the supplier of capital gets interest\nand the supplier of entrepreneurship gets profit. It should be noted that wage,\nrent, interest and profit are paid by the firms in money terms and received by\nthe respective suppliers as factor incomes. Thus national income is measured\nby using income method.\n(ii)   Liquidity and Uniformity of Value\nMoney can be easily carried and is easily divisible into smaller units as per\nconvenience. The liquidity feature of money is manifested at the time when\nit can be withdrawn from the bank account repeatedly in certain amount in\neach transaction. For example, your father has `10,000 deposited in his bank\naccount. You want to purchase a shoe worth `600. Your father can withdraw\nthe amount from the bank to give you. The balance of `9,400 will remain in\nyour father’s account.\nMoney brings uniformity in value of different goods and services which are\nnot comparable physically due to their differences in the units of measurement."

But  they  can  be  added  together  if\nexpressed in monetary units. If a Kg. of rice is worth `25 and a liter of cooking\noil is worth `75, the combined value of rice and oil comes out to be `100.\n28.4  MEASURES  OF  MONEY  SUPPLY  IN  INDIA\nMoney supply refers to the total quantity of money held by public in various forms\nat any point of time in an economy. The main components of money supply are\ncurrency held by the public and net-demand deposits held by the commercial\nbanks. The money supply in Indian economy is generally measured in following\nforms:\n(i)M\n1\n=  Currency (notes and coins) with the public + Demand deposits + other\ndeposits held with the Reserve Bank of India.\n(ii)   M\n2\n=M\n1 \n+ Post Office saving deposits.\n(iii)  M\n3\n=M\n1 \n+ Time deposits of all commercial banks and co-operative banks\n(excluding interbank time deposits).\n(iv)  M\n4\n=M\n3 \n+ Total deposits with the Post Office Saving Organisation (excluding\nNational Saving Certificate).\nOf all the concepts of money supply stated above, M\n1 \nis referred to as narrow\nmeasure and M\n3\n the broader measure of money supply. M\n1 \nis the most important\nmeasure of money supply. M\n1\n is most liquid whereas M\n4\n is least liquid.\n28.5  HIGH  POWERED  MONEY  (H)\nThe  HighPowered  Money  refers  to  the  currency  held  by  the  public  (C),  cash\nreserves of banks (R) and other deposits of the R.B.I.  High Powered Money is\nproduced by the R.B.I. and the Government of India and held by the public and the\nbanks.\nINTEXT  QUESTIONS  28.2\n1.   Which of the following statements are true and which are false?\n(i)    M\n1 \nis a narrow measure and M\n3 \nis a broader measure of money supply.\n(ii)    Currency notes and coins are not an important component of money\nsupply.\n(iii)Supply of money is measured over a period of time.\n(iv)High powered money consists of cash with public, reserves with banks\nand other deposits with R.B.I."

These banks operate both under the public as well private sectors. Some\npublic sector banks include the State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank and\nBank of India among others. The private sector commercial banks may include the\nbanks namely HDFC bank, ICICI bank and HSBC bank among others.\nFunctions of Commercial Banks: The commercial banks normally perform the\nfollowing functions in an economy:\n(i)    Acceptance  of  deposits:  Every  commercial  bank  accepts  deposits  from\ndifferent sections of society including the general public, business entities and\nother institutions. Commercial banks accept following types of deposit:\nzCurrent Account Deposits or Demand Deposits: This type of account\nis generally maintained by the business entities and money under these\ndeposits are payable on demand of the depositor. The depositors are free\nto deposit or withdraw money from their account any number of times\nwithout any restrictions.\nzSavings Account Deposits: This type of account is generally maintained\nby the households or individuals. The depositor can deposit or withdraw\nmoney deposited under this account only for a limited number of times.\nThis  account  also  attracts  a  nominal  rate  of  interest  payable  to  the\naccount holder.\nzFixed Deposit or Time Deposit or Term Deposit: Under this account\nmoney is deposited for a fixed period and the rate of interest is relatively\nhigher than other accounts depending on the tenure of the fixed deposit.\n(ii)   Extending Loans and Advances: This is another important function of a\ncommercial bank. This is also the main source of income of any commercial\nbank. Banks grant loans and advances out of the surplus money after keeping\ncertain percentage of their total deposit called as reserves. Some important\nforms  of  loans  and  advances  are  ordinary  loans, overdraft  facility  and\ndiscounting of bills of exchange.\n(iii) Creation of Credit: This function is derived from the earlier two functions\nof the commercial banks. This unique function has direct impact on the supply\nof money in an economy."

Banks\ncreate credit out of the deposits that is mobilized by them. Credit creation is also\ncalled money creation or deposit creation. Therefore, commercial banks are also\nknown as creator of money or credit.\nThe process of credit/money creation: Money is not created by commercial\nbanks by actually printing of notes or minting of coins. The money is created by\ngranting loans and advances to public and making relevant entries into the books\nof accounts of the lending banks.Loans are granted out of the deposits received by\nthe banks. Normally, the amount of loan granted by a bank is greater than the\namount of deposits received by it. This is mainly because of the fact that when\nmoney is deposited by the depositors in a bank, the bank by its experience knows\nthat not all the money would be withdrawn by the depositors at once at any point\nof time. This peculiar habit of the depositors leaves the bank with huge amount of\nsurplus fund which in turn is used to create loans by the banks. The banks keep\ncertain proportion of its total deposits in form of cash to honour the demand of its\ncustomers. Further, every commercial bank is required to keep certain proportion\nof its total deposits with the R.B.I. which is known as Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR).\nBesides CRR, the bank is also required statutorily to maintain certain proportion\nof its total deposits as liquid assets in form of cash, gold, and certain government\napproved securities. This is known as Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR). The CRR\nand SLR together form the Legal Reserve Ratio (LRR) which is determined by the\ncentral bank of a country (R.B.I. in case of India). When LRR is increased by the\ncentral  bank  the  capacity  of  the  commercial  banks  to  create  deposit  or  credit\ndecreases and when LRR is decreased the capacity to create more credit increases."

Given the quantity of deposits and LRR at any point of time,\nthe total quantity of money created in an economy during a given period of time\nwould be as follows:\nTotal  quantity  of  money  created:  Quantity  of  deposits  ×  1/LRR.  Let  us\nunderstand the process of money or credit creation in an economy with the help\nof an example. Let us assume that the bank receives an initial deposit of ` 1000 and\nthe LRR is 10%. It means the bank has an excess reserve of ` 1000 – (1000 x10%)\n= ` 900 to lend to the borrowers. It must be noted that the borrowers are not paid\nthe amount of loan as cash but the same is credited in their account. Thus in the\nfirst round an extra deposit of ` 900 is created out of which the bank is free to\nadvance loan worth ` 900 – (900 × 10%) = ` 810. In the second round an extra\ndeposit of ` 810 is created and the total amount of money in the economy becomes\n` 1000 + 900 + 810 = ` 2710. If the process continues the total amount of money\ncreated in the economy with ` 1000 would be `1000 × 1/10% = 1000 × 1/0.1 =\n` 1000 × 10 = 10,000 (Ten Thousand). If the amount of LRR is 20% then the initial\ndeposit of ` 1000 would create the total amount of money in the economy worth\n` 1000 × 1/0.2 = ` 5000 (Five Thousand). Thus, a higher LRR would create less\namount of money and a lower LRR would create a higher amount of money\nin the economy.\nIt should further be noted that only a fraction of total deposits is kept as cash\nreserves by banks because of two reasons. First, Banks by their experiences know\nthat all depositors are not going to withdraw their money at the same time so the\nsurplus money could be used to create loans and extra deposits. Second, there is\na continuous flow of deposits in the banks, so banks are comfortable with their cash\nreserves.\nINTEXT  QUESTIONS  28.3\n1.   Which of the following statements are true and which are false?\n(i)    Commercial banks are controlled and operated only by the public sector.\n(ii)Rate of interest on savings account deposits is less than fixed deposits.\n(iii)Functions  of  commercial  banks  are  rising  day  by  day  in  modern\neconomy.\n(iv)Overdraft facility is an important form of granting loan to the public by\nbanks.\n(v)    Increase in legal reserve ratio reduces credit creating power of commercial\nbanks."

The central bank of India is Reserve Bank of India (R.B.I.).\nFunctions  of  Central  Bank\n(i)Bank of issuing or currency: Every central bank of an economy is the sole\nauthority to issue currency. The currency issued by the central bank is backed\nby  minimum  receive  of  assets  like  gold  coins,  gold  bullions  and  foreign\nexchange etc. kept with the central bank. The Minimum Reserve System in\nIndia represent the minimum backing of Rs 200 crores by RBI out of which\nRs 115 crores worth of gold and Rs 85 crores worth of foreign exchange\nsecurities are kept under RBI, the Monetary Authority of India. The authority\nof sole issue of currency has certain benefits like uniformity in currency, better\nmonitoring and control over money supply and public trust and confidence in\nthe currency issued and circulated.\n(ii)Banker to the banks: The central bank acts as a banker to the commercial\nbanks in the following manner:\nzCustodian of the cash reserves of the commercial banks (CRR).\nzLender of the last resort in the sense that if commercial banks fail to\ngenerate enough cash from its own sources it approaches the central\nbank  as  a  last  resort.  The  central  bank  in  turn  may  grant  loans  and\nadvances to the needy banks.\nzThe central bank also acts as central clearing house for the commercial\nbanks.\n(iii)Banker to the government: As a banker to the government the central bank\ncarries out all banking businesses on behalf of both the central government\nand the state governments. It maintains current account of the government for\nkeeping cash balances and also making and receiving payments on behalf of\nthe government. It provides loans and advances to the government. It also\nacts as financial advisor to the government.\n(iv)Custodian  of  the  stock  of  gold  and  foreign  exchange  reserves  of  the\nnation: This function helps in maintaining stability in exchange rate as fixed\nby the government and also enforcing exchange control and other regulations\nfor a favourable balance of payments for the economy.\n(v)Controller  of  credit  and  money  supply:  Credit  control  and  control  of\nmoney supply is probably the most important function of a central bank.\nThrough various methods/instruments of credit control the central bank aims"

All the instruments of credit\ncontrol may broadly be divided into following two categories. These are\ncalled instruments of monetary policy. Monetary policy is the policy of the\ncentral bank to control and regulate money supply and credit in the economy.\n(A)   Quantitative methods of credit control and\n(B)   Qualitative or selective methods of credit control.\nThe Quantitative methods include those instruments which affect the total volume\nof  credit  and  affect  all  sections  of  the  economy.  It  includes  the  following\ninstruments:\n(i)Bank Rate Policy: Bank rate is the rate at which central bank provides loan\nto  the  commercial  banks.  The  increase  in  bank  rate  by  the  central  bank\nincreases the cost of funds to the commercial banks which in turn is passed\non to their customers. High rate of interest reduces demand for loan and thus\nthe  quantity  of  credit/money  in  the  economy  which  squeezes  aggregate\ndemand in the economy. Bank rate is increased to control inflation in an\neconomy and it is reduced to fight deflationary situation in the economy.\n(ii)Open Market Operations: Open market operations refer to the policy of\nsale and purchase of government securities in the open market by the central\nbank. The central bank sells and purchases these securities mainly to and from\nthe public and commercial banks. If the central bank wants to control inflation\nit sells securities in the market so that the excess liquidity may be transferred\nfrom public to the central bank. This measure controls the aggregate demand\nand inflation in the economy. The central bank starts purchasing securities in\nthe market to boost aggregate demand and fight deflation in the economy.\n(iii)Variable Legal Reserve Ratio: The central bank can influence the credit\ncreating power of commercial banks by varying CRR and SLR. Increase in\nLRR reduces credit creation capacity of commercial banks and decrease in\nLRR increases this power of the banks. LRR is increased during inflation and\ndecreased during deflation.\nThe qualitative or selective credit control does not influence the quantity of credit/\nmoney in totality but it is directed towards controlling credit in a particular use of\ncredit. The qualitative methods of credit control are as follows:\n(i)Margin  Requirements:  The  commercial  banks  grant  loan  to  borrowers\nagainst some collateral securities whose value is more than the the value of\nloans granted. The difference between the value of collateral securities and\nthe amount of loan is called margin. Increase in margin requirement reduces\nloan eligibility of the borrower which central uses at the time of inflation.\nDuring deflationary situation margin requirement is reduced to promote the\ngrowth of volume of credit/money in the economy."

In India the financial year spans from 1st April to 31st March over\ntwo calender years.\nGovernment at all levels, whether central, state or a local level, prepare the budget.\nBudget is prepared, keeping in view the general policy of government towards the\nwelfare of people.\nGovernment  incurs  various  expenditures  to  provide  basic  facilities  such  as\neducation, health, etc. It also spends money to increase production, to reduce\nunemployment, poverty and inequalities in income and wealth etc. Such expenditure\nof  government  promotes  welfare  of  the  people.  To  finance  this  expenditure,\ngovernment raises revenue from sources such as taxes, public debt, etc. These\nfinancial resources that fund government expenditure are raised from people.\nThe  items  of  expenditure  and  the  sources  of  financing  them  are  planned  by\ngovernment in accordance with the objective of public welfare. Thus, government\ntakes decisions on behalf of people with respect to how public money is to be spent\nunder different heads of expenditures and how it is to be raised from various\nsources. This makes government accountable to people. Through legislatures,\nparliament and various other civic bodies, people exercise their right to know as\nto how government is spending public money and how it is raising it from them.\nThis accountability of government to the people of the country is manifested in the\ngovernment budget. A budget is a consolidated financial statement prepared\nby government on expected public expenditure and public revenue during a\nfinancial year.\nThere are three main features of a government budget. One, it is a consolidated\nfinancial statement of expected expenditures and various sources of revenue of\ngovernment. Two, it relates to a financial year. And three, the expenditures and the\nsources of revenue are planned in accordance with the declared policy objectives\nof government.\n29.2  STRUCTURE OF BUDGET\nTo understand the basic structure of budget and its various components,  let us\nconsider the budget of the Central Government of India for the financial years\n2012-13 presented in Table 29.1. From this Table we find that the budget has two\nparts:"

Capital receipts,\non the other hand, are the receipts of the government which either create liability\nor cause any reduciton in the assets of the government. e.g. borrowings, recovery\nof loan and disinvestment etc.\nIt must be mentioned here that there is a similarity between the financing by an\nindividual and the financing by a government. An individual, generally, finances his\ncurrent expenditure from his current income. He borrows when his current income\nis  not  sufficient  for  his  current  expenditure.  Likewise,  a  government  has  two\nsources to finance its expenditures: current income or  revenue receipts and capital\nreceipts. It borrows when revenue receipts fall short of its current expenditures.\nThe dissimilarity between financing by an individual and that by a government is\nthat an individual first estimates his current income and then plans his expenditures\nwhile a government plans its expenditures first and then finds the sources to finance\nthem.\n(1) Revenue Receipts\nRevenue  receipts  are  current  incomes  of  government,  which  neither  create\nliabilities nor cause any reduction in the assets of the government. These receipts\nare classified into (a) Tax Revenue and (b) Non-tax Revenue.\n(a) Tax Revenue : A tax is a legal compulsory payment by the people and firms\nto the government of a country without reference to any direct benifit in return..\nIt is imposed on the people by the government. A government collects revenue\nfrom various taxes like income tax, sales tax, service tax, excise duty, custom duty\netc. Traditionally  the  revenue  from  taxes  has  been  the  primary  source  of\ngovernment income.\nIncome tax is imposed on those who earn income such as wages, salaries, rent,\ninterest and profit. Sales tax is the tax on the sale of goods. Whenever we purchase\na good, a part of our payment goes to the government as sales tax. Service tax is\nthe tax we pay when we use a service such as telephone service. Excise duty is a\ntax paid by the producer manufacturing a good. Custom duty is paid when a good\nis imported or exported.\nAll taxes are of two kinds: (a) Direct taxes and (b) Indirect Taxes. This distinction\nbetween taxes depends on (1) the liability of payment of tax to government and (2)\nthe actual burden of tax.\nIn case of direct taxes, the liability of payment and the burden of the tax falls on\nthe same person. For example, income tax is a direct tax because the person who\nis liable to pay it also bears the burden of the tax; The burden of the tax cannot be\nshifted on others. But this does not happen in case of indirect taxes. For example,"

The buyer and not the seller is the one\nwho finally pays the sales tax. The seller only collects the tax from the buyer by\nincreasing the price and pays it to the government. Thus, we find that incase of sales\ntax, the burden of tax is shifted from the seller to the buyer. All taxes on production\nare indirect taxes because producers recover these taxes from buyers by increasing\nthe price of the product.\nExample of Direct Taxes\nzIncome tax: the tax on incomes of individuals\nzCorporation tax : the tax on corporate profits\nzWealth tax: the tax on wealth of individuals\nzGift tax: the tax on gifts given\nExample of Indirect Taxes\nzValue added tax\nzExcise duty: the tax on goods manufactured in factories\nzCustoms duty: the tax on imports and exports\nzService tax: the tax on the services provided\nDifference between Direct Taxes and Indirect Taxes\nS.No.BasisDirect taxesIndirect taxes\n1.ImpactDirect taxes are levied onIndirect taxes are levied\nindividuals and firmson goods and services\n2.Shift ofThe burden of a directThe burden of an indirect\nburdentax cannot be shifted,can be shifted, i.e.\ni.e. impact and incidenceimpact and incidence are\nare on the same personon different persons e.g. a\nseller can increase the price\nof the good after tax is\nimposed so that the buyer\nwill bear the burden of the\ntax.\n3.NatureThey are generallyThey are generally\nprogressive in natureproportionate in nature\n4.CoverageThey have limited reachThey have a wide\nas they do not reachcoverage as they\nall the sections of theaffect all the sections\nsocietyof the society"

The major sources of non-tax revenues of the central government of\nIndia are:\n(i)  Commercial Revenue: It is received by government in the form of prices paid\nby people for goods and services that government provides e.g. people pay for\nelectricity and for services of Railways, postal stamps, toll etc.\n(ii) Administrative Revenue: It arises on account of administrative services of\nthe government. They are as follow:\n(a)    fees in the form of passport fees, government hospital fees, education\nfees, court fee, etc.\n(b)    fine and penalites: charged by government on law-breakers for disobeying\nrules and regulations.\n(c)    licence fee and permit\n(d)    Escheat : Income that government get by taking possession of property\nwhich has no legal claimant or legal heir.\n(e)    Interest receipts\n(f)    profits of public sector undertakings.\n1. Capital Receipts\nAs stated earlier, capital receipts are those receipts of the government which either\ncreate liability or cause any reduction in the assets of the government.\nThe major sources of capital receipts of the central government are: (i) Borrowings\n(ii) Recovery of Loans and (iii) Disinvestment - Resale of shares of public sector\nundertakings.\n(i)    Borrowings: There  are  two  sources  from  which  the  central  government\nborrows. They are:\n(a)    Domestic  Borrowings: The  government  borrows  from  domestic\nfinancial market by issuing securities and treasury bills. It also borrows\nfrom people through various deposit schemes such as Public Provident\nFund, Small Savings Schemes, and National Savings Scheme etc. These\nare borrowings of the government within the country.\n(b)    External  Borrowings: In  addition  to  domestic  borrowings  the\ngovernment also borrows from foreign governments and international\nbodies  like  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  World  Bank  etc.\nForeign borrowings by the government bring in foreign exchange into\nthe domestic economy."

The loans recovered by the central government from\nstate  and  local  governments  are  capital  receipts  in  the  budget  because\nrecovery of loans reduces debtors (assets).\n(iii) Disinvestment - Resale of shares of public sector undertakings: This is a\nvery recent source of capital receipts by which the central government has\nbeen mobilizing financial resources since 1991. Prior to 1991, the central\ngovernment owned 100 percent of the shares of public sector undertakings.\nFrom 1991, the government adopted the policy of privatisation of public\nsector  undertakings.  Consequently,  it  started  selling  its  shares  to  general\npublic and to financial institutions. This selling of shares of public sector\nundertakings  by  the  government  is  known  as  \n‘disinvestment  of  public\nsector undertakings’.\n2.  Expenditure\nGovernment  expenditure  is  classified  in  two  ways:  capital  expenditure  and\nrevenue expenditure and (b) as plan expenditure and non-plan expenditure.\nCapital Expenditure and Revenue Expenditure\nWhen government incurs expenditure to create assets such as school and hospital\nbuildings, roads bridges, canals, railway lines etc., or reduce its liability such as\nrepayment of loan etc., such expenditure is known as \ncapital expenditure. But\nwhen government incurs expenditure that neither creates any asset nor reduces any\nliability,  such  expenditure  is  known  as  revenue  expenditure. For  Example,\npayment of salaries to government employees, maintenance of public property,\nproviding free education and health services to people, etc constitute revenue\nexpenditure. These do not create any public asset.\nPlan Expenditure and Non-Plan Expenditure\nAfter independence, our country adopted the path of planning to achieve economic\ndevelopment. Under planning, provisions were made in the government budget for\nexpenditure that was to be incurred every year according to the priorities laid down\nin the five-year plans. Such expenditure is known as \nplan expenditure.\nBeside  plan  expenditure,  government  also  incurs  routine  expenditure  such  as\nexpenditure on police, judiciary, water supply, sanitation and health, legislatures,\ndefence,  various  government  departments,  etc.  Such  routine  expenditure  is\ntermed as \nnon-plan expenditure."

These are:\n(a)   Borrowing from Public and Foreign Governments\n(b)   Withdrawing Cash Balances held with the Reserve Bank of India (R.B.I.)\n(c)Borrowing from the Reserve Bank of India (R.B.I)\nThe Government ordinarily prefers to borrow either from its citizens or from\nforeign governments instead of withdrawing cash balances held with the R.B.I. or\nborrowing from it. The later two ways to finance deficit increase the supply of\nmoney. The increase in supply of money increases the prices in an economy. On the\nother hand, borrowing domestically from public has no effect on the supply of\nmoney and consequently on prices because when government borrows, the money\nheld by people is transferred to government with no change in the supply of money.\nHowever,  the  money  supply  would  increase  when  government  borrows  from\nforeign  countries.  The  last  two  ways  to  finance  deficit  increase  the  supply  of\nmoney. Any money that flows out of the R.B.I. increases the supply of money in\neconomy and increases the prices in domestic economy.\n29.5  BUDGETARY POLICY (FISCAL POLICY)\nNow  you  will  know  about  budgetary  policy.  Budgetary  policy  relates  to  two\nimportant issues. These are:\n1.   The items on which the government should spend\n2.   How the government should raise resources to finance its expenditure?\nThe answer to the first question will depend on the priorities of the government\nto solve various economic, social and other problems that a country faces. For\nexample,  if  there  is  a  constant  threat  of  attack  from  another  country,  the\ngovernment has no choice but to spend more on defence. If there is a threat of\noutbreak and spread of an epidemic, the government has to spend more on health\nservices. If the government had taken loan in the past, it has to spend more on\ninterest payments.\nOn the second question the government has to consider various ways to raise\nresources. Should the people be taxed more? Which section of the people to be\ntaxed more? Which commodities are to be taxed? How much the government\nshould borrow? From whom should it borrow and in what form? The answers to\nthese questions are to be found in the policy objectives of the government."

To generate revenue and to increase expenditures, the\ngovernment finance or policy called Budgeting policy or fiscal policy.\nThe major fiscal measures are:\n1.   Public Expenditure – Government spends money on a wide variety of things,\nfrom the military and police to services like education and health care, as well\nas transfer payments such as welfare benefits.\n2.   Taxation – Government imposes new taxes and change the rate of current\ntaxes. The expenditure of government is funded by the imposition of taxes.\n3.   Public Borrowing – Government also raises money from the population  or\nfrom abroad through bonds, NSC, Kisan Vikas Patra, etc.\n4.   Other Measure – Other measures adopted by the government are:\n(a)    Rationing and price control\n(b)    Regulation of wages\n(c)    Increase the production of goods and services.\nObjectives of Budget and Budgetary Policy\n1.   To promote economic growth: Government promotes economic growth by\nsetting up basic and heavy industries like steel, chemical, fertilizers, machine\ntools, etc. It also builds infrastructure like roads, canals, railways, airports,\neducation and health services, water and electricity supply, telecommunications,\netc. that foster economic growth.\nBoth basic and heavy industries and infrastructure require huge amount of\ninvestment which normally the private sector does not take up. Since these\nindustries and infrastructure facilities are essential for economic growth in the\ncountry, the burden to set up and develop them falls on the government.\n2.   To reduce income and wealth inequalities: Government reduces inequalities\nin income and wealth by taxing the rich more and spending more on the poor.\nFurther, it provides for the employment opportunities to poor that help them\nto earn.\n3.   To  provide  employment  opportunities: Employment  opportunities  are\nincreased by the government in various ways, One, jobs are created when it sets\nup public sector enterprises. Two, it provides subsidies and other incentives\nlike  tax  holidays,  low    rates  of  taxes  etc.  to  private  sector  that  encourage\nproduction  and  employment.  It  also  encourages  setting  up  of  small  scale,\ncottage and village industries by people which are employment oriented. This\nit does by providing them tax concessions, subsidies, grants, loans at low rates\nof interest, etc. Finally, it creates jobs for poor when it undertakes public works\nprogrammes like construction of roads, bridges, canals, buildings, etc."

To correct balance of payments deficit: The balance of payments account\nof a country records its receipts and payment with foreign countries. When\npayments to foreigners are more than receipts from foreigners, the balance of\npayments account is said to be in deficit. Quite often this deficit is caused when\na  country  imports  more  than  it  exports.  Consequently,  the  payments  on\nimports  to  foreigners  are  more  than  the  receipts  from  exports.  In  such  a\nsituation, to reduce the deficit in balance of payment account, the government\ndiscourages imports by increasing taxes on them and encourages exports  by\nincreasing subsidies and other export incentives. However, it should be noted\nthat tax on import is not a popular measure now as it is treated as an obstacle\nto free flow of goods and services between countries.\n6.

For example, demand for coke is elastic because it has\nmany substitutes like, Limka, Pepsi etc. On the other hand demand\nfor  electricity  is  inelastic  because  it  has  no  substitute.\n(ii) Nature  of  the  Commodity:\nDemand for necessities like medicines, food grains, food etc. is less\nelastic  because  we  have  to  consume  them  in  minimum  required\nquantity, whatever their price may be. But demand for comforts and\nluxuries  like  air-conditioners  etc.  is  more  elastic  because  their\nconsumption  may  be  postponed  for  future  if  their  price  rises.\n—Or  any  other  relevant  point  (any  two)1\n1\n2\n×23\n14.Explicit  Cost:\nAll  actual  payments,  on  purchasing  and  hiring  different  goods  and1\nservices  in  production  are  called  explicit  costs\ne.g.  wages  of  workers\n1\n2\nQ.Expected  Value  pointsDistribu-Total\n.No.tionMarks\nof  Marks"

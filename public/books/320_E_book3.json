Education  is  an  instrument  of\nchange. The right type of education at right time can bring about positivity in the\noutlook  of  society,  attitudinal  changes  to  face  the  new/fresh  challenges  and  the\ncourage to face difficult situations.\nThis can be very effectively achieved by the curriculum renewal at regular intervals\nof time. A static curriculum does not serve any purpose, as it does not cater to the\ncurrent needs and aspirations of the individual and society.\nFor  this  purpose  only,  educationists  from  all  over  the  country  come  together  at\nregular intervals to deliberate on the issues of changes needed and required. As an\noutcome  of  such  deliberations,  the  National  Curriculum  Framework  (NCF  2005)\ncame out, which spells out in detail the type of education desirable/needed at various\nlevels of education – primary, elementary, secondary or senior secondary.\nKeeping this framework and other national and societal concerns in mind, we have\ncurrently revised the curricula of Accountancy course at Senior Secondary Level, as\nper the Common Core Curriculum developed by COBSE (Council of Boards of School\nEducation) and NCERT (National Council for Educational Research and Training)\nmaking  it  current  and  need  based.  Textual  material  production  is  an  integral  and\nessential part of all NIOS programmes offered through open and distance learning\nsystem.  Therefore,  we  have  taken  special  care  to  make  the  learning  material  user\nfriendly,  interesting  and  attractive  for  you.\nI  would  like  to  thank  all  the  eminent  persons  involved  in  making  this  material\ninteresting and relevant to your needs. I hope you find it appealing and absorbing.\nOn  behalf  of  National  Institute  of  Open  Schooling,  I  wish  you  all  a  bright  and\nsuccessful future.\nProf. C.B.

It\ndetermines financial strength and weaknesses of the firm.\nAnalysis of financial statements is an attempt to assess the efficiency and performance\nof an enterprise.

Financial  analysis  helps  in\nascertaining whether adequate profits are being earned on the capital invested\nin the business or not. It also helps in knowing the capacity to pay the interest\nand dividend.\nzz\nzz\nz\nIndicating the Trend of Achievements : Financial statements of the previous\nyears can be compared and the trend regarding various expenses, purchases,\nsales, gross profits and net profit etc. can be ascertained. Value of assets and\nliabilities can be compared and the future prospects of the business can be\nenvisaged.\nzz\nzz\nzAssessing  the  Growth  Potential  of  the  Business  :  The  trend  and  other\nanalysis of the business provides sufficient information indicating the growth\npotential of the business.\nzz\nzz\nzComparative Position in Relation to Other Firms : The purpose of financial\nstatements analysis is to help the management to make a comparative study of\nthe profitability of various firms engaged in similar businesses. Such comparison\nalso helps the management to study the position of their firm in respect of sales,\nexpenses, profitability and utilising capital, etc.\nzz\nzz\nz\nAssess overall financial strength : The purpose of financial analysis is to\nassess the financial strength of the business. Analysis also helps in taking\ndecisions,  whether  funds  required  for  the  purchase  of  new  machines  and\nequipments are provided from internal sources of the business or not if yes, how\nmuch? And also to assess how much funds have been received from external\nsources.\nzz\nzz\nz\nAssess solvency of the firm : The different tools of an analysis tell us whether\nthe firm has sufficient funds to meet its short term and long term liabilities or not.\nParties Interested\nAnalysis of financial statements has become very significant due to widespread interest\nof various parties in the financial results of a business unit. The various parties interested\nin the analysis of financial statements are :\n(i)Investors : Shareholders or proprietors of the business are interested in the well\nbeing of the business. They like to know the earning capacity of the business and\nits prospects of future growth.\n(ii)Management : The management is interested in the financial position and\nperformance of the enterprise as a whole and of its various divisions. It helps them\nin preparing budgets and assessing the performance of various departmental heads.\n(iii)  Trade Unions : They are interested in financial statements for negotiating the\nwages or salaries or bonus agreement with the management.\nFinancial Statements Analysis - An Introduction"

As a result of\nwhich they can demand better remuneration and congenial working environment.\n(ix)  Government and their Agencies : Government and their agencies need financial\ninformation to regulate the activities of the enterprises/industries and determine\ntaxation policy. They suggest measures to formulate policies and regulations.\n(x)   Stock Exchange : The stock exchange members take interest in financial statements\nfor the purpose of analysis because they provide useful financial information about\ncompanies.\nThus, we find that different parties have interest in financial statements for different\nreasons.\nLimitations of Financial Analysis\nFinancial analysis helps the interested parties to make an assessment of the earning\ncapacity and financial soundness of a business enterprise. But such analysis has its own\nlimitations. Such limitations should be kept in mind while using the informations provided\nby the financial analysis. Some of the limitations are as follows :\n(i)Limitations of Financial Statements : Financial analysis is based on financial\nstatements. But financial statements themselves suffer from certain limitations, hence\nthe limitations of financial statements are also the limitations of their analysis. For\nexample, (a) sometimes the information given in financial statements are incomplete\nand not authentic, (b) financial Statements are based on accounting concepts and\nconventions. As such, the utility of financial analysis is decreased due to the\nshortcomings of financial statements.\n(ii)Affected by Window-dressing : Some firms resort to window-dressing their\nfinancial statements to cover up bad financial position on the eve of accounting\ndate. For example, they may not record the purchases made at the end of the year\nor they may overvalue their closing stock. In such cases, the results obtained by\nanalysis of financial statements will be misleading.\nFinancial Statements Analysis - An Introduction"

      "content": "13\nNotes\nMODULE  -  6\nAnalysis of Financial\nStatements\nACCOUNTANCY\n(iii)  Different Accounting Policies : If two firms adopt different accounting policies,\nthe comparison between the two will be unreliable. For example, one firm may\nprovide depreciation on original cost method, whereas the other firm may adopt\nthe written-down value method for providing the depreciation. Similarly, the method\nof valuation of closing stock may also differ from one firm to another. The results\nobtained from the comparison of the financial statements of such firms may give\nmisleading picture.\n(iv)Difficulty in Forecasting : Financial statements are a record of past events and\nhistorical facts. In the fast changing and developing modern business, the analysis\nof past information may not be of much use in future forecasting. Continuous\nchanges take place in the demand of the product, policies adopted by the firm, the\nposition of competition etc. As such, no estimate based on the analysis of historical\nfacts can be made for future.\n(v)   Lack of Qualitative Analysis : Financial statements record only those events\nand transactions which can be expressed in terms of money. qualitative aspects of\nbusiness units are omitted from the books at all as these cannot be expressed in\nmonetary terms. Thus, changes in management, reputation of the business, cordial\nmanagement-labour relations, firm’s ability to develop new products, efficiency of\nmanagement, satisfaction of firm’s customers etc. which have a vital bearing on\nthe profitability of the company are all ignored and omitted from being recorded\nbecause all of these are qualitative in nature.\n(vi)Limited Use of Single Year’s Analysis of Financial Statements : Results\nobtained from financial analysis assume significance only when compared with the\nfigures of previous periods. For example, the profit of a firm to sales is 12%,\nwhether this is satisfactory or not, will depend upon the figures of previous years.\nIf the firm earned 10% of sales as profit in the previous year, it may be considered\nto have done better this year. However, the financial statements of two years may\nnot be comparable due to the changes in accounting policies.\nIt is clear from the above mentioned limitations that the results obtained from analysis\nof financial statements should not be taken as the true indicators of the strength and\nweaknesses of the concern. The results obtained from analysis must be read carefully\nand cautiously. The limitations of analysis must be kept in mind while taking decisions\nbased on the results obtained from such analysis.\nI.Fill in the blanks with suitable word/words :\n(i)Financial statements are ...................... and ......................\n(ii)The term financial analysis include both ...................... and ......................\nINTEXT  QUESTIONS  31.1\nFinancial Statements Analysis - An Introduction"

They are not readily understandable to\ninterested parties like creditors, shareholders, investors etc. Thus, various techniques\nare used for analysing and interpreting the financial statements. Techniques of analysis\nof financial statements are mainly classified into three categories :\n(i)Cross-sectional Analysis : It is also known as inter firm comparison. \nThis analysis\nhelps  in  analysing  financial  characteristics  of  an  enterprise  with  financial\ncharacteristics of another similar enterprise in that accounting period. For example,\nif company A has earned 15% profit on capital invested. This does not say whether\nit is adequate or not. If we analyse further  and find that a similar company has\nearned 16% during the same period, then only we can make a conclusion that\ncompany B is better than company A. Thus, it turns into a meaningful analysis.\n(ii)   Time Series Analysis : It is also called as intra-firm comparison. According to\nthis method, the relationship between different items of financial statements is\nestablished, comparisons are made and results obtained. The basis of comparison\nmay be :\n\u001dComparison of the financial statements of different years of the same business\nunit.\nFinancial Statements Analysis - An Introduction"

It is possible to extend such a comparison over the year. This\napproach is most effective in analysing of financial statements.\nThe analysis and interpretation of financial statements is used to determine the financial\npositon. A number of tools or methods or devices are used to study the relationship\nbetween financial statements. However, the following are the important tools which are\ncommonly used for analysing and interpreting financial statements :\nzComparative financial statementszCommon size statements\nzTrend analysiszRatio analysis\nzFunds flow analysiszCash flow analysis\nzz\nzz\nz\nComparative financial Statements\nIn brief, comparative study of financial statements is the comparison of the financial\nstatements of the business with the previous year’s financial statements. It enables\nidentification of weakpoints and applying corrective measures. Practically, two financial\nstatements (balance sheet and income statement) are prepared in comparative form for\nanalysis purposes.\n1.Comparative Balance Sheet : The comparative balance sheet shows the\ndifferent assets and liabilities of the firm on different dates to make comparison\nof balances from one date to another. The comparative balance sheet has two\ncolumns for the data of original balance sheets. A third column is used to show\nchange (increase/decrease) in figures. The fourth column may be added for giving\npercentages of increase or decrease. While interpreting comparative Balance\nsheet the interpreter is expected to study the following aspects :\n(i)Current financial position and Liquidity position\n(ii)Long-term financial position\n(iii)Profitability of the concern\n(i)For studying current financial position or liquidity position of a concern one\nshould examine the working capital in both the years. Working capital is the\nexcess of current assets over current liabilities.\n(ii)For studying the long-term financial position of the concern, one should\nexamine the changes in fixed assets, long-term liabilities and capital.\n(iii)The next aspect to be studied in a comparative balance sheet is the profitability\nof the concern. The study of increase or decrease in profit will help the\ninterpreter to observe whether the profitability has improved or not.\nFinancial Statements Analysis - An Introduction"

You have also learnt various tools of analysis of financial statements\nsuch as comparative statements, common size statement, and trend analysis. However,\nlike the above tools another important tool which is very useful to examine the financial\nstatements is ratio analysis. Accounting ratios are calculated from the financial statements\nto arrive at meaningful conclusions pertaining to liquidity, profitability, and solvency.\nAccounting ratios can be of different types. In this lesson, we will learn about different\ntypes of accounting ratios and their methods of calculation.\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to :\nzstate the meaning of accounting ratio;\nzclassify the accounting ratios;\nzexplain various types of accounting ratios on the basis of liquidity and turnover.\n  32.1  OBJECTIVES  OF  RATIO  ANALYSIS\nRatios are regarded as a test of earning capacity, financial soundness and operating\nefficiency of a business organisation. The use of ratios in accounting and financial\nmanagement analysis helps the management to know the profitability, financial position\n(liquidity and solvency) and operating efficiency of an enterprises.\nThe objectives of ratio analysis may be better understood by the following advantages\nof ratio analysis.\nAdvantages and Uses of Ratio Analysis\nThe advantages derived by an enterprise by the use of accounting ratios are:\nOBJECTIVES"

Bankers, investors, creditors,\netc., all analyse Balance Sheets and Profit and Loss Accounts by means of ratios.\nii.Useful in Simplifying Accounting Figures : Accounting ratio simplifies,\nsummarises and systematises a long array of accounting figures to make them\nunderstandable. Its main contribution lies in communicating precisely the inter-\nrelationships which exist between various elements of financial statements.\niii.Useful in Judging the Operating Efficiency of Business : Accounting ratios\nare essential for understanding the affairs of an enterprise, specially its operating\nefficiency. Accounting ratios are also useful for diagnosis of the financial health of\nan enterprise. This is done by evaluating liquidity, solvency, profitability, etc. Such\nan evaluation enables the management to assess financial requirements and the\ncapabilities of various business units.\niv.    Useful for Forecasting : Ratios are helpful in business planning and forecasting.\nThe trend ratios are analysed and used as a guide to future planning. What should\nbe the course of action in the immediate future is decided, many a times, on the\nbasis of trend ratios, i.e., ratios calculated for a number of years.\nv.Useful in Locating the Weak Spots : Accounting ratios are of great assistance\nin locating the weak spots in the business even though the overall performance\nmay be quite good. Management can pay attention to the weakness and take\nremedial action. For example, if the firm finds that the increase in distribution\nexpenses is more than proportionate to the results achieved, these can be examined\nin detail and depth to remove any wastage that may be there.\nvi.    Useful in Inter-firm and Intra-firm Comparison : A firm would like to compare\nits performance with that of other firms and of industry in general. The comparison\nis called inter-firm comparison. If the performance of different units belonging to\nthe same firm is to be compared, it is called intra-firm comparison. Such comparison\nis almost impossible without accounting ratios. Even the progress of a firm from\nyear to year cannot be measured without the help of ratios. The accounting ratios\nare the best tools to compare the various firms and divisions of a firm.\n  32.2  MEANING  AND  ITS  CLASSIFICATION\nThe ratio is an arithmetical expression i.e. relationship of one number to another. It may\nbe defined as an indicated quotient of the mathematical expression. It is expressed as a\nproportion or a fraction or in percentage or in terms of number of times. A financial\nratio is the relationship between two accounting figures expressed mathematically.\nSuppose two accounting figures of a concern are sales ` 1,00,000 and profits ` 15,000.\nThe ratio between these two figures will be\n000,00,1\n000,15\n = 3 : 20 or 15%\nAccounting Ratios - I"

These are the indicators of\nfinancial strength, soundness, position or weakness of an enterprise. One can draw\nconclusions about the financial position of a concern with the help of accounting ratios.\nSuppose one shopkeeper (X) earns a profit of ` 1,000 and another (Y) earns ` 20,000\nwhich one is more efficient? We may say that the one who earns a higher profit is\nrunning his shop better. In fact to answer the questions, we must ask, how much is the\ncapital employed by each shopkeeper? Let, X employ `1,00,000 and Y  ` 4,00,000.\nWe can work out the percentage of profit earned by each to the capital employed.\nThus,\nX =\nY =\nThese figures show that for every `100 of capital, X earns ` 10 and Y earns ` 5. X is\nobviously making a better use of the funds employed by him. He must be treated as\nmore efficient of the two. The above example shows that absolute figures by themselves\ndo not communicate the meaningful information.\nBroadly accounting ratios can be grouped into the following categories :\n(a)  Liquidity ratios(b)  Activity ratios(c)  Solvency ratios\n(c)  Profitability ratios\nLiquidity Ratios\nThe term liquidity refers to the ability of the company to meet its current liabilities.\nLiquidity ratios assess capacity of the firm to repay its short term liabilities. Thus, liquidity\nratios measure the firms’ ability to fulfil short term commitments out of its liquid assets.\nThe important liquidity ratios are :\n(i)Current Ratio\n(ii)    Quick Ratio\n(i)    Current Ratio : Current ratio is a ratio between current assets and current\nliabilities of a firm for a particular period. This ratio establishes a relationship\nbetween current assets and current liabilities. The objective of computing this\nratio is to measure the ability of the firm to meet its short term liability. It compares\nthe current assets and current liabilities of the firm. This ratio is calculated as\nunder :\nCurrent ratio =\n` 10,000\n` 1,00,000\nX100 = 10%\n` 20,000\n` 4,00,000\nX100 = 5%\nCurrent Assets\nCurrent Liabilities\nAccounting Ratios - I"

In India, this ratio may be taken as acceptable if it is 2 : 1. If the debt-\nequity ratio is more than that, it shows a rather risky financial position from the long\nterm point of view.\nSignificance\nThe purpose of debt equity ratio is to derive an idea of the amount of capital supplied\nto the concern by the proprietors. This ratio is very useful to assess the soundness of\nlong term financial position of the firm. It also indicates the extent to which the firm\ndepends upon outsiders for its existence. A low debt equity ratio implies the use of\nmore equity than debt.\nIllustration 1\nFrom the following, calculate the debt-equity ratio\n`\nEquity Shares Capital1,00,000\nGeneral Reserve45,000\nAccumulated Profits30,000\nDebentures75,000\nSundry trade creditors40,000\nOutstanding expenses10,000\nSolution :\nDebt-equity Ratio=\n= = 3 : 7\nWorking Notes : Shareholders’ Fund  =Equity Share Capital + Reserves +\nAccumulated Profits\nOutsiders’ Funds\nShareholders’ Funds\n`75,000\n`1,75,000\nDebt (Total Long term Loans)\nEquity (Shareholders Funds)\nAccounting Ratios - II"

Through\naccounting ratios, it will be easy to know the true financial position and financial soundness\nof a business concern. However, despite the advantages of ratio analysis, it suffers\nfrom a number of limitations. The following are the main limitations of accounting ratios.\nzIgnorance of Qualitative Aspect : The ratio analysis is based on quantitative\naspect. It totally ignores qualitative aspect which is sometimes more important\nthan quantitative aspect.\nzIgnorance of Price Level Changes : Price level changes make the comparison\nof figures difficult over a period of time. Before any comparison is made, proper\nadjustments for price level changes must be made.\nzNo Single Concept : In order to calculate any ratio, different firms may take\ndifferent concepts for different purposes. Some firms take profit before charging\ninterest and tax or profit before tax but after interest tax. This may lead to different\nresults.\nOperating Profit\nRevenue from Operations (Net Sales)\n100\n` 60,000\n` 3,00,000\nX100 = 20%\nINTEXT  QUESTIONS  32.2\nOperating Profit\nNet Sales\nX100\nAccounting Ratios - II\nX"

Thus, management of cash is very essential. There should be\nfocus on movement of cash and its equivalents. Cash means, cash in hand and demand\ndeposits with the bank. Cash equivalent consists of bank overdraft, cash credit, short\nterm deposits and marketable securities.\nCash Flow Statement deals with flow of cash which includes cash equivalents as well\nas cash. This statement is an additional information to the users of Financial Statements.\nThe statement shows the incoming and outgoing of cash. The statement assesses the\ncapability of the enterprise to generate cash and utilize it. Thus a Cash-Flow statement\nmay be defined as a summary of receipts and disbursements of cash for a particular\nperiod of time. It also explains reasons for the changes in cash position of the\nfirm. Cash flows are cash inflows and outflows. Transactions which increase the cash\nposition of the entity are called as inflows of cash and those which decrease the cash\nposition as outflows of cash. Cash flow Statement traces the various sources which\nbring in cash such as cash from operating activities, sale of current and fixed assets,\nissue of share capital and debentures etc. and applications which cause outflow of cash\nsuch as loss from operations, purchase of current and fixed assets, redemption of\ndebentures, preference shares and other long-term debt for cash. In short, a cash flow\nstatement shows the cash receipts and disbursements during a certain period. The\nstatement of cash flow serves a number of objectives which are as follows :\nzCash flow statement aims at highlighting the cash generated from operating activities.\nzCash flow statement helps in planning the schedule for repayment of loan\nschedule and replacement of fixed assets, etc.\nzCash is the centre of all financial decisions. It is used as the basis for the projection\nof future investing and financing plans of the enterprise.\nzCash flow statement helps to ascertain the liquid position of the firm in a better\nmanner. Banks and financial institutions mostly prefer cash flow statement to analyse\nliquidity of the borrowing firm.\nzCash flow Statement helps in efficient and effective management of cash.\nzThe management generally looks into cash flow statements to understand the\ninternally generated cash which is best utilised for payment of dividends.\nzCash Flow Statement based on AS-3 (revised) presents separately cash generated\nand used in operating, investing and financing activities.\nzIt is very useful in the evaluation of cash position of a firm.\nCash Flow Statement"

It is therefore, a non-operating item which\nshould not be permitted to affect the calculation of cash generated by operating\nactivities. Thus, the amount of proposed dividends would be added back to\ncurrent years profit and payments made during the year in respect of dividends\nwould be shown as an outflow of cash.\n(iii)Share Capital : The increase in share capital is regarded as inflow of cash only\nwhen there is an increase in share capital. For example, if a company issues\n10000 equity shares of ` 10 each for cash only, ` 100,000 would be shown\nas inflow of cash from financing activities. Similarly, the redemption of preference\nshares is an outflow of cash. But where the share capital is issued to finance\nthe purchase of fixed assets or the debentures are converted into equity shares\nthere is no cash flow. Further, the issue of bonus shares does not cause any cash\nflows.\n(iv)  Purchase or sale of fixed Assets : The figures appearing in the comparative\nbalance sheets at two dates in respect of fixed assets might indicate whether a\nparticular fixed asset has been purchased or sold during the year. This would\nenable to determine the inflows or outflows of cash. For example, If the plant\nand machinery appears at ` 60,000 in the current year and `50,000 in the\nprevious year, the only conclusion, in the absence of any other information is\nthat there is a purchase of fixed assets for `10000 during the year. Hence,\n`10000 would be shown as outflow of cash.\n(v)   Provision  for  Taxation  :  It  is  a  non-operating  expenses  or  an  item  of\nappropriation in the Income statement/Profit and Loss Account and therefore\nshould not be allowed to reduce the cash provided from operating activities.\nHence, if the profit is given after tax and the amount of the provision for tax\nmade during the year is given, the same would be added back to the current\nyear profit figure.\nIn the cash flow statement, the tax paid would be recorded separately as an outflow of\ncash. The item of provision for taxation, would not be treated as current assets.\nSometimes, the only information available about provision for taxation in the opening\nbalance sheet and closing balance sheet. In such a case the figure in the opening balance\nsheet is treated as an outflow of cash while the figure in the closing balance sheet is\ntreated as a non-cash and non-operating expense and thus is added back to net Income\nfigure to find out the cash provided from operating activities.\nIllustration 5\nThe comparative balance sheets of Bansal Private Limited at two different dates provide\nthe following information.\nCash Flow Statement"

Some of the significant limitations of Cash\nFlow Statement are given below:\nzIt is very difficult to precisely define the term ‘cash’\nzThere are controversies over a number of items like cheques, stamps, postal orders\netc. to be included in cash or not.\nzAs the present business moves from the cash basis to accrual basis, the prepaid\nand credit transactions might be represented an increase in working capital and it\nwould be misleading to equate net income to cash flow because a number of non\ncash items would affect the net income.\nCash Flow Statement"

Visually, the spreadsheet\nlooks like any other matrix with rows and columns. It is also known as a worksheet.\nThis worksheet is so large that the human eye cannot view all its rows and columns at\na point of time. Therefore, user focuses on few rows and columns and keeps changing\nthe focus to the required part of the worksheet, as and when required. It is normally\nused for calculations and comparison of numerical or financial data for arriving at the\ndesired information for reporting. An electronic spreadsheet is a computer program\nthat allows the user to add and process data. The concept of electronic spreadsheet\ncan well be understood with the help of MS Excel, which is one of the MS office\nsoftware.\n  35.2  BASICS  AND  FEATURES  OF  SPREADSHEET\nA spreadsheet is characterized by certain features, given as under:\n1.   Grid : By definition, a spreadsheet is seen as grid structured by number of rows\nand columns. Each row is sequentially assigned number such as 1,2,3.... And\nevery column is assigned an alphabet for identification. First 26 columns are assigned\nalphabets beginning A to Z and thereafter, the columns begins with AA followed by\nAB till the last column is assigned alphabets.\n2.   Element : Each element of spreadsheet is defined by a point of intersection between\na particular row and column. It is therefore, addressed by referring to the relevant\nrow and column. For example, the element A1 means the first row of column A.\nThe element is capable of storing data and formulae for calculations.\n3.   Lens View : Spreadsheet allows the user to view and concentrate on a limited\nnumber of rows and columns to work with.\n4.   Functions : Spreadsheet is supported by a large number of functions capable of\nperforming difficult and lengthy calculations in fractions of seconds.\n5.   Formatting : Spreadsheet has text formatting capabilities. This enables the\ngenerated report to be saved, printed and exported to other applications for use.\n6.   Save, Print and Export : Spreadsheet is saved as a file so that it can be opened\nfor additions and alterations as per the need arisen. It can also be printed by selecting\na part of the entire sheet. It can also be sent to mail recipient as an attachment.\nElectronic Spread Sheet"

It will change cell addresses relative\nto the row and column they are moved to. For example, if a simple addition formula in\ncell C1 “=(A1+B1)” is copied to cell C2, the formula would change to “=(A2+B2)” to\nreflect the new row.\nTo prevent this change, cells must be called by \nabsolute referencing and this is\naccomplished by placing dollar signs “$” within the cell addresses in the formula.\nContinuing the previous example, the formula in cell C1 would read “=($A$1+$B$1)”\nif the value of cell C2 should be the sum of cells A1 and B1. Both the column and row\nof both cells are absolute and will not change when copied.\nMixed referencing can also be used where only the row OR column fixed. For\nexample, in the formula “=(A$1+$B2)”, the row of cell A1 is fixed and the column of\ncell B2 is fixed.\nLinking Worksheets\nYou may want to use the value from a cell in another worksheet within the same\nworkbook in a formula. For example, the value of cell A1 in the current worksheet and\ncell A2 in the second worksheet can be added using the format “sheetname!celladdress”.\nThe formula for this example would be “=A1+Sheet2!A2” where the value of cell A1\nin the current worksheet is added to the value of cell A2 in the worksheet named\n“Sheet2”.\nElectronic Spread Sheet"

To understand and explain the chart/\ngraph we will learn all basic elements of the chart.\n1.   The chart area : The entire chart including all elements.\n2.   The  plot  area: In a 2-D chart, the area is bounded by the X and Y axis. In a 3-\nD chart, the area is bounded by the three (X, Y and Z) axis.\n3.   The data points: Individual values plotted in a chart and represented by bars,\ncolumns, lines, pie or various other shapes are called \ndata markers. Data markers\nof the same colour constitute a data  series. The data series are related data\npoints that are plotted in the chart/ graph. Each data series in a chart is shown in a\nunique colour or pattern or both. Its identification is given by the legend. There may\nbe more than one data series in a chart/graph.\n4.   The horizontal (category) and vertical (value) axis : The x-axis is usually the\nhorizontal line which contains categories (independent values or categories) and y-\naxis is usually the verticals which contains data (dependent values).\n5.   The legend : It is an identifier of a piece of information shown in the chart/graph.\nThe legends are assigned to the data series or different categories in a chart\n6.   A  chart  and  axes  titles : Descriptive text for chart title and axis title.\n7.   A  data  label : This provides additional information about a data marker to identify\nthe details of data point in a data series. Some of the elements are displayed by\ndefault when we prepare the chart/graph; others can be added as needed. It is also\npossible to change the format or display of the chart/graph as desired.\n  37.3  FORMATTING  OF  CHART\nFormatting the Chart (using design option)\nNow, we will learn how the elements of a chart such as plot area, X-axis, Y-axis, data,\ntitles, labels, legends and gridline can be formatted and edited as per the requirement.\nClick anywhere in the chart. This will display the \nChart Tools, adding the Design,\nLayout, and Format tabs.Using  Design option we can change the look of a chart. In\nthe Design dialog box, we can click to change chart type, chart layouts and chart\nstyles. One of the options provide for 2-d chart to swap the column data to row data\nand row data to column data.\nThe steps are as follows:\nIn a chart click the chart element to change, or do the following to select the chart\nelement from a list of chart elements:\nGraphs and Charts"

By pressing the left button, and drag/ pull as desired to\nresize the chart.\n  37.5 ADVANTAGES  IN  USING  GRAPHs/CHARTs\n1.   Help to Explore : Many times we would like to see if there is a relationship\nbetween variables. Suppose that we wanted to determine if there is a relationship\nbetween: a country’s GNP and the infant mortality rate, between age and between\ngenders. It may be quicker and easier to create a chart immediately to see the\npossible relationship of variables to one another, rather than paging through raw\ndata.\n2.   Help to Present : We want to provide information in as little time as possible.\nGraphing plays a key role. It seems that there is no longer any time to sit and read\na newspaper in order to find out what is going on. However, newspapers, such as\nThe Economics Times and India Today magazines (which were early users of charting\ntechniques), seem to understand this phenomena and provide graphs to convey\nand sum up ideas that they are making in their articles.\n3.   Help to Convince : The same way that a graph can be used to present and\nexplore different characteristics of data, it can also be used to convince. Graphs\nhave the ability to take large amounts of information and make them into exhibitions\nthat are easily used to persuade.\nGraphs and Charts"

These difficulties, among\nothers, prompted the development of database systems which represents data into the\nrelational tables for the logical view of the database.\nIn order to understand how data is stored in a database to produce reliable and\nmeaningful information, let us take an hypothetical case of an accounting database for\nmaintaining data relating to accounting transactions of a business firm named Unique\nElectronics. The process of structuring a database comprises following elements:\n38.1.1 Requirement Analysis\nRequirements Analysis is the first and most important stage while designing a database.\nThis stage involves assessing the informational needs of an organization, also referred\nto as Reality. The data requirements are used as a source for database design such as:\n1.   Data to be stored in the database.\n2.   Frequency of the data to be modified.\n3.   Users types of database.\n4.   Level of hardware and operating system available.\n5.   Will the database (back end) be used by any other front end application?\nIn our hypothetical case i.e., Unique Electronics, accounting transactions needs to be\nrepresented conceptually with full description i.e., accounting transactions are\ndocumented via vouchers. Voucher exhibits the date of transaction, amount of transaction,\naccount name and account code (both for debit and credit entry) and the narration with\nrespect to the transaction happened. Then the support documents are attached to the\naccounting voucher. The transactions are documented with respect to the category of\naccounts affected. These accounts are then classified into the categories (account types):\nExpenditure, Income, Assets, Liabilities and Capital.\n38.1.2 Conceptual  Design\nAfter collecting and analyzing all requirements of an organization, a Conceptual diagram\nis developed for the database known as Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram. ER diagram\nconsists of entities, the attributes related to these entities and their relationships.  Entity\nis a real-world object, distinguishable from other objects. An entity is described using\na set of attributes. An attribute is a property that describes an entity. Relationships\nare used to tie together different entities (two or more entities). Relationships can also\nhave their own attributes.\n38.1.3 Logical Design\nIt is representational data model through which ER design is transformed into inter-\nrelated data tables. Accordingly, there emerge five tables in our hypothetical case of\nUnique Electronics:\nDatabase Management System"

A tabular format displays\nthe caption of fields on the same line so that respective information contents appear\nin the next line.\n   \n  Creation of queriesAccounting reports\nSkill Review 2\nAccounting Tasks  for preparing Purchase Journal for an organisation\nIPreparation of purchase journal: conceptual design\nStep 1: Create Tables\nTable 1: Supplier_Mst\nSup_code\n[Primary Key]Number\nSup_name Text25\nTot_Pur_AmtNumberDecimal\nTot_Amt_PaidNumberDecimal\nOutstanding_AmtNumberDecimal\nTable 2: Pur_Bill\nPur_vr_no\n[Primary Key]NumberLong Integer\nPur_vr_DateDate/TimeShort date\nSup_codeNumberLong Integer\nQtyNumberDecimal\nRateNumberDecimal\nDatabase Management System"

A table has a number of\nrows (or records) and columns (or fields or attribute). Each row contains a records\nof information, for example of an account head or a party or a transactions as per\nthe need. The information in a row consists of a sequence of columns or attributes,\nsuch as transaction number, transaction date, etc, or it could be party’s name,\nparty’s address, etc.\n One of the tasks in analysis of requirement is to identify and list out the information\nrequired including its elements. These elements of information become columns\n(attributes) in appropriate tables.\n Data (set of attributes) should be logically structured so as to put them in various\ntables. The goal of such structuring is to reduce data redundancy, to achieve data\nconsistency as well as to enhance efficiency for adding, updating and querying\noperations on database. Data redundancy can be removed by normalisation process.\n Since the data stored in different tables may be related, such relationship is\nimplemented by establishing links between tables. The database created on the\nbasis of such relationships between different tables is called relational database.\n Relationship between tables is established with the help of primary key and foreign\nkey. Primary key consists of minimum possible one or more than one attributes of\na table, which uniquely identifies each row of that table. Foreign key consists of set\nof attributes, which from primary key in another (related) table.\n Most of Computerised Accounting Systems are multi-user systems. These systems\nuse ‘server database’ unlike single-user (or desktop) systems using ‘desktop\ndatabase’. In a multi user system, a user interacts with the software though the user\ninterface, which is also termed as ‘front-end’. Database, which is kept on a server,\nis termed as a ‘back-end’.\n MS-Access is an example of ‘desktop database’. Oracle, SQL Server, IBM-\nDB2 is examples of ‘server databases’, Desktop databases may be satisfactory\nfor SOHO (Small Office Home Office) organisations as they offer inexpensive and\nsimple solutions to many of business data storage and processing requirements.\n In order to provide security and consistency of data, database is not directly\naccessible to users. Any addition or retrieval of information from database is done\nby user-friendly programs. Database is thus rightly referred to as ‘back-end’ while\nthe interactive program, that includes user interface, is termed as ‘front-end’ of a\ndatabase application.\nDatabase Management System"

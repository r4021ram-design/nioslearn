He used matrices to represent simultaneous\nsystem of equations. As of now, theory of matrices has come to stay as an important area of\nmathematics. The matrices are used in game theory, allocation of expenses, budgeting for\nby-products etc. Economists use them in social accounting, input-output tables and in the study\nof inter-industry economics. Matrices are extensively used in solving the simultaneous system of\nequations. Linear programming has its base in matrix algebra. Matrices have found applications\nnot only in mathematics, but in other subjects like Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, Linear\nProgramming etc.\nIn this lesson we will discuss different types of matrices and algebraic operations on matrices in\ndetails.\n  OBJECTIVES\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to:\ndefine a matrix, order of a matrix and cite examples thereof;\ndefine and cite examples of various types of matrices-square, rectangular, unit, zero,\ndiagonal, row, column matrix;\nstate the conditions for equality of two matrices;\ndefine transpose of a matrix;\ndefine symmetric and skew symmetric matrices and cite examples;\nfind the sum and the difference of two matrices of the same order;\nmultiply a matrix by a scalar;\nstate the condition for multiplication of two matrices; and\nmultiply two matrices whenever possible.\nuse elementary transformations\nfind inverse using elementary trnsformations\n  EXPECTED    BACKGROUND    KNOWLEDGE\nKnowledge of number system\nSolution of system of linear equations"

In solving such systems of equations, you used the process of elimination\nof variables. When the number of variables invovled is large, such elimination  process becomes\ntedious.\nYou have already learnt an alternative method, called Cramer’s Rule for solving such systems of\nlinear equations.\nWe will now illustrate another method called the matrix method, which can be used to solve the\nsystem of equations in large number of unknowns. For simplicity the illustrations will be for\nsystem of equations in two or three unknowns.\n22.5.1 MATRIX METHOD\nIn this method, we first express the given system of equation  in the matrix form AX = B, where\nA is called the co-efficient matrix.\nFor example, if the given system of equation is a\n1\nx + b\n1\ny = c\n1\n and a\n2 \nx + b\n2 \ny = c\n2\n, we express\nthem in the matrix equation form as :\n \nab\nab\nx\ny\nc\nc\n11\n22\n1\n2\nL\nN\nM\nO\nQ\nP\nL\nN\nM\nO\nQ\nP\n\nL\nN\nM\nO\nQ\nP\nHere,A = \nab\nab\n11\n22\nL\nN\nM\nO\nQ\nP\n, X= \nx\ny\nL\nN\nM\nO\nQ\nP\n and B =\nc\nc\n1\n2\nL\nN\nM\nO\nQ\nP\nIf the given system of equations is a\n1 \nx + b\n1 \ny + c\n1 \nz = d\n1\n, a\n2 \nx + b\n2 \ny + c\n2 \nz = d\n2 \nand\na\n3 \nx + b\n3 \ny + c\n3 \nz = d\n3\n,then this system is expressed in the matrix equation form as:"

Because the first element in two or more ordered pairs will be the same. So we\nconclude that\nevery function is not invertible.\n Example 24.1      If  f : R \n\n R defined by \n3\n(x)x4   f\n.

The idea can be expressed by saying that the\nlimiting value of f(x) is 2 when x approaches to 1.\nLet us consider another function f (x) =2x. Here, we are interested to see its behavior near the\npoint 1 and at x = 1. We find that as x gets nearer to 1, the corresponding value of f (x) gets\ncloser to 2 at x = 1 and the value of f (x) is also 2.\nTable - 2\nxf (x)\n1.92.9\n1.82.8\n1.72.7\n1.62.6\n1.52.5\n::\n::\n1.12.1\n1.012.01\n1.0012.001\n::\n::\n1.000012.00001\n                  Table -1\nxf(x)\n0.51.5\n0.61.6\n0.71.7\n0.81.8\n0.91.9\n0.911.91\n::\n::\n0.991.99\n::\n::\n0.99991.9999"

In this lesson we define derivative of a function, give its geometrical and physical\ninterpretations, discuss various laws of derivatives and introduce notion of second order derivative\nof a function.\n OBJECTIVES\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to :\ndefine and interpret geometrically the derivative of a function y = f(x) at x = a;\nprove that the derivative of a constant function f(x) = c, is zero;\nfind the derivative of  f \nn\n(x)x   , n    Q\nfrom first principle and apply to find the derivatives\nof various functions;\nfind the derivatives of the functions of the form cf(x),\n\n\nf   xg  x\nand  polynomial functions;\nstate and apply the results concerning derivatives of the product and quotient of two functions;\nstate and apply the chain rule for the derivative of a function;\nfind the derivative of algebraic functions (including rational functions); and\nfind second order derivative of a function.\n    EXPECTED  BACKGROUND  KNOWLEDGE\nBinomial Theorem\nFunctions and their graphs\nNotion of limit of a function\n    26.1 DERIVATIVE  OF A  FUNCTION\nConsider a function and a point say (5,25) on its graph. If x changes from 5 to 5.1, 5.01,\n5.001..... etc., then correspondingly, y changes from 25 to 26.01, 25.1001, 25.010001,....A\nsmall change in x causes some small change in the value of y. We denote this change in the value\nof x by a symbol \nx\nand the corresponding change caused in y by yand call these respectively\nas an increment in x and increment in y, irrespective of sign of increment.

There are many\nother areas where growth and decay are continuous in nature. Examples from the fields of\nEconomics, Agriculture and Business can be cited, where growth and decay are continuous.\nLet us consider an example of bacteria growth. If there are 10,00,000 bacteria at present and\nsay they are doubled in number after 10 hours, we are interested in knowing as to after how\nmuch time these bacteria will be 30,00,000 in number and so on.\nAnswers to the growth problem does not come from addition (repeated or otherwise), or\nmultiplication by a fixed number. In fact Mathematics has a tool known as exponential function\nthat helps us to find growth and decay in such cases. Exponential function is inverse of logarithmic\nfunction. We shall also study about Rolle's Theorem and Mean Value Theorems and their\napplications. In this lesson, we propose to work with this tool and find the rules governing their\nderivatives.\nOBJECTIVES\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to :\nldefine and find the derivatives of exponential and logarithmic functions;\nlfind the derivatives of functions expressed as a combination of algebraic, trigonometric,\nexponential and logarithmic functions; and\nlfind second order derivative of a function.\nlstate Rolle's Theorem and Lagrange's Mean Value Theorem; and\nltest the validity of the above theorems and apply them to solve problems.\n  EXPECTED  BACKGROUND  KNOWLEDGE\nlApplication of the following standard limits :\n(i)\nx\nx0\ne1\nlim1\nx\n\n\n(ii)\nx\ne\nx0\na1\nlimlog  a\nx\n\n\n(iii)\n\nh\nh0\ne1\nlim1\nh\n\n\n"

So, for\ncontinuous function we have maximum (minimum) value in an interval and these values are not\nabsolute maximum (minimum) of the function. For this reason, we sometimes call them as local\nmaxima or local minima.\nA function f (x) is said to have a maximum or a local maximum at the point x = a where a\n– b < a < a + b (See Fig. 29.7), if\n\nf   af   a    b   \n for all sufficiently small positive b.\n      \nFig. 29.7Fig. 29.8\nA maximum (or local maximum) value of a function is the one which is greater than all other\nvalues on either side of the point in the immediate neighbourhood of the point.\nA  function  f  (x)  is  said  to  have  a  minimum  (or  local  minimum  )  at  the  point  x  =  a  if\n\nf   af   a    b   \nwhere a – b< a < a + b\nfor all sufficiently small positive b.\nIn Fig. 25.8, the function f(x) has local minimum at the point x = a.\nA minimum ( or local miunimum) value of a function is the one which is less than all other values,\non either side of the point in the immediate neighbourhood of the point.\nNote : A neighbourhood of a point x \n\nR is defined by open internal ]x\n\n[, when \n\n>0.\n    29.9.1  CONDITIONS  FOR  MAXIMUM  OR  MINIMUM\nWe know that derivative of a function is positive when the function is increasing and the derivative\nis negative when the function is decreasing. We shall apply this result to find the condition for\nmaximum or a function to have a minimum. Refer to Fig. 25.6, points B,D, F are points of\nmaxima and points A,C,E are points of minima.\nNow, on the left of B, the function is increasing and so \n\nf '  x0, but on the right of B, the\nfunction is decreasing and, therefore, \n\nf '  x0\n. This can be achieved only when f '(x) becomes\nzero somewhere in betwen. We can rewrite this as follows :\nA function f (x) has a maximum value at a point if (i) f '(x) = 0 and (ii) f '(x) changes sign from\npositive to negative in the neighbourhood of the point at which f '(x)=0 (points taken from left to\nright)."

Once again f '(x) will be zero before\nhaving positive values. We rewrite this as follows :\nA function f (x) has a minimum value at a point if (i) f '(x)=0, and (ii) f '(x) changes sign from\nnegative to positive in the neighbourhood of the point at which f '(x) = 0.\nWe should note here that f '(x) = 0 is necessary condition and is\nnot a sufficient condition for maxima or minima to exist. We can\nhave a function which is increasing, then constant and then again\nincreasing function. In this case, f '(x) does not change sign.The\nvalue for which f '(x) = 0 is not a point of maxima or minima.\nSuch point is called point of inflexion.\nFor example, for the function \n\n3\nf   xx  , x0\n is the point of\ninflexion as \n\n2\nf '  x3x\n does not change sign as x passes\nthrough 0. f'(x) is positive on both sides of the value '0' (tangents\nmake acute angles with x-axis) (See Fig. 29.9).\nHence \n\n3\nf   xx\n has a point of inflexion at x = 0.\nThe points where f '(x) = 0 are called stationary points as the rate ofchange of the function is zero\nthere. Thus points of maxima and minima are stationary points.\nRemarks\nThe stationary points at which the function attains either local maximum or local minimum\nvalues are also called extreme points and both local maximum and local minimum values are\ncalled extreme values of f (x). Thus a function attains an extreme value at x=a if f (a) is either\na local maximum or a local minimum.\n 29.9.2 METHOD OF FINDING MAXIMA OR MINIMA\nWe have arrived at the method of finding the maxima or minima of a function. It is as follows :\n(i)Find  f'(x)\n(ii)Put f '(x)=0 and find stationary points\n(iii)Consider the sign of f '(x) in the neighbourhood of stationary points. If it changes sign\nfrom +ve to –ve, then f (x) has maximum value at that point and if f '(x) changes sign from\n–ve to +ve, then f (x) has minimum value at that point.\n(iv)If f '(x) does not change sign in the neighbourhood of a point then it is a point of inflexion.\n Example 29.30    Find the maximum (local maximum) and minimum (local minimum) points of\nthe function \n\n32\nf   xx3x9x      \n.\nSolution : Here\n\n32\nf   xx3x9x      \n\n2\nf '  x3x6x    9       \nFig. 29.9"

In order to solve such problems, we follow the steps in the following\norder :\n(i)Frame the function in terms of variables discussed in the data.\n(ii)With the help of the given conditions, express the function in terms of a single variable.\n(iii)Lastly, apply conditions of maxima or minima as discussed earlier.\n Example 29.39   Find two positive real numbers whose sum is 70 and their product is maximum.\nSolution : Let one number be x. As their sum is 70, the other number is 70x. As the two\nnumbers are positive, we have, \nx0, 70    x0  \n70   x    0  \n\nx    70\n\n0    x    70  \nLet their product be f (x)\nThen\n2\nf (x)x(70   x)    70x    x      \nWe have to maximize the prouct f (x).\nWe, therefore, find f '(x) and put that equal to zero.\nf '(x) = 70 –2x\nFor maximum product, f ' (x) = 0\nor        70 –2x = 0\nor     x = 35\nNow f\"(x) = –2 which is negative. Hence f (x) is maximum at x = 35\nThe other number is \n70   x    35  \nHence the required numbers are 35, 35.\n Example 29.40    Show that among rectangles of given area, the square has the least perimeter.\nSolution : Let x, y be the length and breadth of the rectangle respectively."

(See Fig. 31.1)\nNow, let f (x) be a continuous function defined on the closed interval [a, b].

Now the problem is to find the area of the shaded region.\nIn order to solve this problem, we consider three special cases of  f (x) as rectangular region ,\ntriangular region and trapezoidal region.\nThe area of these regions  = base × average height\nIn general for any function f (x) on [a, b]\nArea of the bounded region (shaded region in Fig. 31.3 ) = base × average height\nThe base is the length of the domain interval [a, b]. The height at any point x is the value of  f (x)\nat that point. Therefore, the average height is the average of the values taken by f in [a, b]. (This\nmay not be so easy to find because the height may not vary uniformly.) Our problem is how to\nfind the average value of f in [a,b].\n31.1.1   Average Value  of  a  Function  in  an    Interval\nIf there are only finite number of values of f in [ a,b], we can easily get the average value by the\nformula.\nAverage value of f in \n\n\nSum of the values of f in   a, b\na, b\nNumbers of values\n\nBut in our problem, there are infinite number of values taken by f in [ a, b]. How to find the\naverage in such a case? The above formula does not help us, so we resort to estimate the\naverage value of f in the following way:\nFirst Estimate : Take the value of  f at 'a' only. The value of f at a is f (a). We take this value,\nnamely f (a), as a rough estimate of the average value of f in [a,b].\nAverage value of f in [a, b] ( first estimate ) = f (a)(i)\nSecond Estimate : Divide [a, b] into two equal parts or sub-intervals.\nLet the length of each sub-interval be h, \nba\nh\n2\n\n\n.\nTake the values of f at the left end points of the sub-intervals.

Conversely, given any ordered pair (x, y) there\ncorresponds a point in the plane whose co-ordinates are (x, y).\nLet a rubber ball be dropped vertically in a room The point on the floor, where the ball strikes,\ncan be uniquely determined with reference to axes, taken along the length and breadth of the\nroom. However, when the ball bounces back vertically upward, the position of the ball in space\nat any moment cannot be determined with reference to two axes considered earlier. At any\ninstant, the position of ball can be uniquely determined if in addition, we also know the height of\nthe ball above the floor.\nIf the height of the ball above the floor is 2.5cm\nand the position of the point where it strikes\nthe ground is given by (5, 4), one way of\ndescribing the position of ball in space is with\nthe help of these three numbers (5, 4, 2.5).\nThus, the position of a point (or an article) in\nspace can be uniquely determined with the\nhelp of three numbers. In this lesson, we will\ndiscuss in details about the co-ordinate system\nand co-ordinates of a point in space, distance\nbetween two points in space, position of a\npoint dividing the join of two points in a given\nratio  internally/externally  and  about  the\nprojection of a point/line in space.\n OBJECTIVES\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to :\nlassociate a point, in three dimensional space with given triplet and vice versa;\nlfind the distance between two points in space;\nlfind the coordinates of a point which divides the line segment joining twogiven points in a\ngiven ratio internally and externally;\nldefine the direction cosines/ratios of a given line in space;\nlfind the direction cosines of a line in space;\nFig. 33.1\nFig. 33.1"

We could\nhave taken any corner of the room (for\nthe matter any point of the room) as origin\nof reference, and relative to that the co-\nordinates of the point change. Thus, the\norigin can be taken arbitarily at any point\nof the room.\nLet us start with an arbitrary point O in\nspa ce   a nd   d raw   t hre e   mu t ually\nperpendicular  lines  X'OX,  Y'OY  and\nZ'OZ through O. The point O is called the\norigin of the co-ordinate system and the\nlines X'OX, Y'OY and Z'OZ are called\nthe  X-axis,  the  Y-axis  and  the  Z-axis\nrespectively. The positive direction of the\naxes are indicated by arrows on thick lines\nin Fig. 33.2. The plane determined by the\nX-axis and the Y-axis is called XY-plane\n(XOY  plane)  and  similarly,  YZ-plane\n(YOZ-plane) and ZX-plane (ZOX-plane)\ncan be determined. These three planes are\ncalled  co-ordinate  planes.  The  three\ncoordinate planes divide the whole space\ninto eight parts called octants.\nLet P be any point is space. Through P\ndraw perpendicular PL on XY-plane\nmeeting this plane at L. Through L draw a line LA\nparallel to OY cutting OX in A. If we write OZ = x, AL\n= y and LP = z, then (x, y, z) are the co-ordinates of\nthe point P.\nFig. 33.3\nFig. 33.2\nO"

Conversely, given any triplet (x, y, z), there corresponds a point P in space\nwhose co-ordinates are (x, y, z).\n Remarks\n1.Just as in plane co-ordinate geometry, the co-ordinate axes divide the plane into four\nquadrants, in three dimentional geometry, the space is divided into eight octants by the\nco-ordinate  planes,  namely  OXYZ,  OX'YZ,  OXY'Z,  OXYZ',  OXY'Z',  OX'YZ',\nOX'Y'Z and OX'Y'Z'.\n2.If P be any point in the first octant, there is  a point in each of the other octants whose\nabsolute distances from the co-ordinate planes are equal to those of P. If P be (a, b, c),\nthe other points are (a, b, c), (a, b, c), (a, b, c), (a, b, c), (a, b, c), (a, b, c)\nand (a, b, c) respectively in order in the octants referred in (i).\n3.The co-ordinates of point in XY-plane, YZ-plane and ZX-plane are of  the form (a, b,\n0), (0, b, c) and (a, 0, c) respectively.\n4.The co-ordinates of points on X-axis, Y-axis and Z-axis are of the form (a, 0, 0), (0, b,\n0) and (0, 0, c) respectively.\n5.You may see that (x, y, z) corresponds to the position vector of the point P with reference\nto the origin O as the vector \nOP\nJJJG\n.\n Example 33.1    Name the octant wherein the given points lies :\n(a) (2, 6, 8)(b) (1, 2, 3)(c) (2, 5, 1)\nFig. 33.4\nO"

We also come across physical quantities such as dispacement, velocity,\nacceleration, momentum etc. which are of a difficult type.\nLet us consider the following situation. Let A, B, C and D be\nfour points equidistant (say 5 km each) from a fixed point P. If\nyou are asked to travel 5 km from the fixed point P, you may\nreach either A, B, C, or D. Therefore, only starting (fixed\npoint) and distance covered are not sufficient to describe the\ndestination. We need to specify end point (terminal point) also.\nThis idea of terminal point from the fixed point gives rise to the\nneed for direction.\nConsider another example of a moving ball. If we wish to\npredict the position of the ball at any time what are the basics\nwe must know to make such a prediction?\nLet the ball be initially at a certain point A. If it were known that the ball travels in a straight\nline at a speed of 5cm/sec, can we predict its position after 3 seconds ? Obviously not.\nPerhaps we may conclude that the ball would be 15 cm away from the point A and therefore\nit will be at some point on the circle with A as its centre and radius 15 cms. So, the mere\nknowledge of speed and time taken are  not sufficient to\npredict the position of the ball. However, if we know\nthat the ball moves in a direction due east from A at a\nspeed of 5cm/sec., then we shall be able to say that\nafter 3 seconds, the ball must be precisely at the point P\nwhich is 15 cms in the direction east of A.\nThus, to study the displacement of a ball after time t (3\nseconds), we need to know the magnitude of its speed\n(i.e. 5 cm/sec) and also its direction (east of A)\nIn this lesson we will be dealing with quantities which have\nmagnitude only, called scalars and the quantities which\nhave both magnitude and direction, called vectors. We\nwill  represent  vectors  as  directed  line  segments  and\ndetermine their magnitudes and directions. We will study about various types of vectors and\nperform operations on vectors with properties thereof. We will also acquaint ourselves with\nposition vector of a point w.r.t. some origin of reference. We will find out the resolved parts of a\nvector, in two and three dimensions, along two and three mutually perpendicular directions\nFig. 34.1\nFig. 34.2"

Take any line l (called a support). The\nportion of L with end points A and B is called a line segment.\nThe line segment AB along with direction from A to B is written\nas   and  is  called  a  directed  line  segment.A  and  B  are\nrespectively called the initial point and terminal point of the vector\n.\nThe length AB is called the magnitude or modulus of \nand is denoted by ||.

Zero vectors is also denoted by \n0\n\n to distinguish\nit from the scalar 0.\n 34.3.2 Unit Vector\nA vector whose magnitude is unity is called a unit vector.

Thus, \na\n\n= |\na\n\n| \nˆ\na\n.\n 34.3.3 Equal Vectors\nTwo vectors \na\n\n and \nb\n\n are said to be equal if they have the\nsame magnitude. i.e., |\na\n\n| = |\nb\n\n| and the same direction as\nshown in Fig. 14.4. Symbolically, it is denoted by  \na\n\n = \nb\n\n.\n Remark : Two vectors  may be equal even if they have\ndifferent parallel lines of support.\n34.3.4 Like Vectors\nVectors are said to be like  if they have same direction\nwhatever be their magnitudes.

The addition (subtraction) of vectors is different from that of numbers\n(scalars).\nIn fact, there is the concept of resultant of two vectors (these could be two velocities, two forces\netc.) We illustrate this with the help of the following example :\nLet us take the case of a boat-man trying to cross a river in a boat and reach a place directly in\nthe line of start. Even if he starts in a direction perpendicular to the bank, the water current\ncarries him to a place different from the place he desired., which is an example of the effect of\ntwo velocities resulting in a third one called the resultant velocity.\nThus, two vectors with magnitudes 3 and 4 may not result, on addition, in a vector with magnitude\n7. It will depend on the direction of the two vectors i.e., on the angle between them. The addition\nof vectors is done in accordance with the triangle law of addition of vectors."

The floor and roof are\nparts of two parallel planes extending infinitely beyond the boundary. You will also see two pairs\nof  parallel  walls  which  are  also  parts  of  parallel  planes.\nSimilarly, the tops of tables, doors of rooms etc. are examples\nof parts of planes.\nIf we consider any two points in a plane, the line joining these\npoints will lie entirely in the same plane. This is the characteristic\nof a plane.\nLook at Fig.35.1.You know that it is a representation of a\nrectangular box. This has six faces, eight vertices and twelve\nedges.\nThe pairs of opposite and parallel faces are\n(i)ABCD and FGHE\n(ii)AFED and BGHC\n(iii)ABGF and DCHE\nand the sets of parallel edges are given below :\n(i)AB, DC EH and FG\n(ii)AD, BC, GH and FE\n(iii)AF, BG, CH and DE\nEach of the six faces given above forms a part of the plane, and there are three pairs of parallel\nplanes, denoted by the opposite faces.\nIn this lesson, we shall establish the general equation of a plane, the equation of a plane passing\nthrough three given points, the intercept form of the equation of a plane and the normal form of\nthe equation of a plane. We shall show that a homogeneous equation of second degree in three\nvariables x,y and z represents a pair of planes. We shall also find the equation of a plane bisecting\nthe angle between two planes and area of a triangle in space.\n  OBJECTIVES\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to :\nlidentify a plane;\nFig. 35.1"

In the\nmarket there are various types of toys available. From quality point of view, he finds that the toy\nof type ‘A’ and type ‘B’ are suitable. The cost price of type ‘A’ toy is Rs. 300 each and that of\ntype ‘B’ is Rs. 250 each. He knows that the type ‘A’ toy can be sold for Rs. 325 each, while\nthe type ‘B’ toy can be sold for Rs. 265 each. Within the amount available to him he would like\nto make maximum profit. His problem is to find out how many type ‘A’ and type ‘B’ toys\nshould be purchased so to get the maximum profit.\nHe can prepare the following table taking into account all possible combinations of type ‘A’ and\ntype  ‘B’ toys subject to the limitation on the investment.\n ‘A’ type‘B’ type  Investment  Amount after saleProfit on the\n(includinginvestment\nthe unutilised\namount if any)\n06  1500.001590.0090.00\n14  1300.001585.0085.00\n23  1350.001595.0095.00\n32  1400.001605.00105.00\n41  1450.001615.00115.00\n50  1500.001625.00125.00\nNow, the decision leading to maximum profit is clear. Five type A toys should be purchased.\nThe above problem was easy to handle because the choice was limited to two types, and the\nnumber of items to be purchased was small. Here, all possible combinations were thought of\nand the corresponding gain calculated. But one must make sure that he has taken all possibilities\ninto account.\nA situation faced by a retailer of radio sets similar to the one given above is described below.\nA retailer of radio sets wishes to buy a number of transistor radio sets from the wholesaler.\nThere are two types (type A and type B) of radio sets which he can buy. Type A costs Rs.360\neach and type B costs Rs. 240 each. The retailer can invest up to Rs. 5760. By selling the radio\nsets, he can make a profit of Rs. 50 on each set of type A and of Rs. 40 on each set of type B.\nHow many of each type should he buy to maximize his total profit?"

The retailer knows that he cannot sell\nmore than 20 sets, so he does not want to buy more than 20 sets and he cannot afford to pay\nmore than Rs.5760.

In mathematical language, there\nare two kinds of reasoning. (i) Inductive reasoning and (ii) Deductive reasoning. We have\nalready discussed the inductive reasoning in mathematical induction. Now, we shall discuss\nsome fundamentals of deductive reasoning.\n38.2  STATEMENT  (OR  PROPOSITION)\nThe basic unit involved in mathematical reasoning is a mathematical statement :\nA sentence is called a mathematically acceptable statement if it is either true or false\nbut not both at the same time.\nIf a statement is true, we say that it is a valid statement. A false statement is known\nas an invalid statement.\nlConsider the following two sentences :\nThree plus four is 6.\nTwo plus three is 5.\nWhen we read these sentences, we immediately decide that the first sentence is wrong\nand second is correct. There is no confusion regarding these. In mathematics such\nsentences are called statements.\nlNow consider the following sentence :\nMathematics is fun.\nMathematics is fun is true for those who like mathematics. But, for others, it may not\nbe true. So, the given sentence is true or false both. Hence, it is not a statement.\nlConsider the following sentences :\n(i)Moon revolves around the Earth.\n(ii)Every square is a rectangle.\n(iii)The Sun is a Star.\n(iv)Every rectangle is a square.\n(v)New Delhi is in Pakistan\nWhen we read these sentences, the first, second and third sentences are true but\nfourth and fifth are-false sentences. Hence, each of them is a statement."

For example, consider the\nstatement.\nr : If you are born in some country, then you are a citizen of that country.\nWe observed that if corresponds to two statements p and q given by\np : you are born in some country\nq : you are citizen of that country\np and q are two statements forming the implication “if p then q”, then we denoted this\nimplication by “p q”.\nthen, “if p then q” is the same as the following :\n(i)If both p and q are true, then(ii)If p is true and q is false, then\np q is also true.p q is  false.\n(iii)If p is false and q is true, then(iv)If p and q both are false, then\np q is  truep q  is   true.\nConsider the following statements\nIf a number is a multiple if 9, then it is a multiple of 3.\nIt is an implication having antecedent(p) and consequent(q) as :\np : a number is multiple of 9\nq : a number is multiple of 3.\nthe above statement says that\n(i)p is sufficient condition for q.\nthis says that knowing that a number is a multiple of 9 is sufficient to conclude that\nit is a multiple of 3.\n(ii)p only if q.\nThis states that a number is a multiple of 9 only if it is a multiple of 3.\n(iii)q is necessary condition for p.\nThis says that when a number is a multiple of 9, it is necessarily a multiple of 3.\n(iv)~q implies ~p.\nThis says that if a number is not a multiple of 3, then it is not a multiple of 9.\n38.6    CONTRAPOSITIVE AND  CONVERSE\nContrapositive : If p and q are two statements, then the contrapositive of the implication\n“if p then q” is “if ~q, then ~p”.\nConverse : If p and q are two statements, then the converse of the implication “if p-then\nq” is “if q-then p”.\nFor example,"

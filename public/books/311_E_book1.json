Education  is  an  instrument  of\nchange. The right type of education at right time can bring about positivity in the\noutlook  of  society,  attitudinal  changes  to  face  the  new/fresh  challenges  and  the\ncourage to face difficult situations.\nThis  can  be  very  effectively  achieved  by  regular  periodic  curriculum  renewal. A\nstatic  curriculum  does  not serve  any  purpose,  as  it  does  not cater  to  the  current\nneeds  and aspirations  of the  individual and  society.\nFor  this  purpose  only,  educationists  from  all  over  the  country  come  together  at\nregular  intervals  to deliberate  on the  issues  of changes  needed  and required. As\nan outcome of such deliberations, the National Curriculum Framework (NCF 2005)\ncame  out,  which  spells  out  in  detail  the  type  of  education  desirable/needed  at\nvarious levels of education – primary, elementary, secondary or senior secondary?\nKeeping  this  framework  and  other  national  and  societal  concerns  in  mind,  we\nhave currently revised the curriculum of Mathematics course at senior secondary\nlevel,  as  per  the  Common  Core  Curriculum  provided  by  National  Council  of\nEducational Research and Traning (NCERT) and the Council of Boards of School\nEducation in India (COBSE) making it current and need based. Textual material\nproduction is an integral and essential part of all NIOS programmes offered through\nopen and distance learning system. Therefore, we have taken special care to make\nthe  learning material user friendly, interesting  and  attractive for  you.\nI  would  like  to  thank  all  the  eminent  persons  involved  in  making  this  material\nInteresting  and  relevant  to  your  needs.  I  hope  you  will  find  it  appealing  and\nabsorbing.\nOn  behalf  of  National  Institute  of  Open  Schooling,  I  wish  you  all  a  bright  and\nSuccessful future.\n   (Dr. S. S.

      "content": "MATHEMATICS IN INDIA\nMathematics is considered to be a system of logic. It is the subject of systematic study of quantitative\nphenomena around us. It is based on certain logical connotation of numbers and integral part of\nhuman civilisation.  Mathematics is a creative activity and is one of the most useful, fascinating\nand stimulating divisions of human knowledge. It is a process of managing and communicating\ninformation and has the power to predict and provide solutions to practical problems as well as\nenabling the individual to create new imaginative worlds to explore. We use Mathematics in\neveryday life, in science, in industry, in business and in our free time. Mathematics education is\nconcerned with the acquisition, understanding and application of skills. Mathematical literacy is\nof central importance in providing the learner with the necessary skills to live a full life as a child\nand later as an adult. Society needs people who can think and communicate quantitatively and\nwho can recognize situations where Mathematics can be applied to solve problems. It is necessary\nto make sense of data encountered in the media, to be competent in terms of vocational\nmathematical literacy and to use appropriate technology to support such applications.\n The earliest traces of Mathematical knowledge in the Indian subcontinent appear right from the\nancient period. The three main contributions in the field of Mathematics were the notation system,\nthe decimal system and the use of zero.Aryabhata worked on the place value system using\nletters to signify numbers.  The most significant contribution of Indian Mathematicians were the\nintroduction of zero (0) to the Mathematics, which is understood as “nothing”.  The concept itself\nwas one of the most significant inventions in the ascent of humans for the growth of culture and\ncivilization.Brahmaguptaintroduced negative numbers and operations on zero into Mathematics.\nHe wrote Brahm, Sputa Siddantika through which Arabs came to know them the Mathematical\nsystem.Bhaskaracharya otherwise known as Bhaskara-II was one of the most powerful and\ncreative mathematicians of ancient India. He contributed the idea of infinity, negative numbers\nand Zero rules in the field of Mathematics.\nBaudhayan was the first one ever to arrive at several concepts in Mathematics, which were\nlater rediscovered by the western world. The value ofPi\n\n\nwas first calculated by him. Pythagoras\ntheorem is already found in Baudhayan’s Sulvasutra, which was written several years before the\nage of Pythagoras.Mahaviraacharyaanother prominent Mathematician in India contributed\non trigonometric functions and cubic equations. He described Fraction, algebraic equations,\nlogarithms and exponents in a very interesting manner. Sridhar another highly esteemed Indian\nMathematician who has contributed to the solution quadratic equation.    \nAstronomy is the applied Mathematics that used Mathematical equations to describe the universe\nor to predict various aspects of the universe. Mathematics is and always has been of central\nimportance to  astronomy. In  ancient India,Nagarjuna a  famous astronomer  as well  as\nmathematician used different equations of Mathematics to describe motion of stars and planets.\nVarahamihira was an Indian astrologer whose main work was on mathematical astronomy. He\ndiscovered a version of Pascal’s triangle and worked on magic square much before Pascal’s\nperiod. He was also aware of gravity over a millennium before Newton."

      "content": "During modern period, Srinivasa Ramanujanwas one of India’s greatest Mathematical geniuses.\nRamanujan’s contribution was mostly on Number theory and he had obtained over mastery the\nnumber 1729. Ramanujan discovered that 1729 is the smallest number which could be represented\nin two different ways as a sum of two cubes. After that,1729 has been called “Ramanujan-Hardy\nnumber”.Shakuntala Devi is a world renowned Indian Mathematician. She has been nicknamed\n‘Human Computer” because of her innate ability to solve complex mathematical problems without\nusing any kind of aid. \nThe main goal of Mathematics education in schools is the Mathematisation of the child’s thinking.\nClarity of thought and pursuing assumptions to logical conclusions is central to the Mathematical\nenterprise. There are many ways of thinking, and the kind of thinking one learns in Mathematics\nis an ability to handle abstractions, and an approach to problem solving. The procedural knowledge\ni.e. to solve problems for getting answers only is not enough. At the Senior Secondary stage one\nneeds to develop both procedural as well as conceptual knowledge for better understanding of\nMathematics. Success in Mathematics requires more than just computational skills. It also requires\nthe ability to apply Mathematics in solving problems, to more information from a variety of\nsources. Senior Secondary stage is the launching pad from which the learner is guided towards\ncareer choices, whether learners aspire in university education or otherwise. By this time, the\nlearners’ interests and aptitude have been largely determined, and Mathematics education in\nthese two years can help in sharpening their abilities.\nMany university degrees require Mathematics as a pre requirement. Learners who choose not to\ntake Mathematics seriously or to ignore it in secondary and senior secondary level forfeit many\nfuture career opportunities that they could have. They essentially turn their backs on more than\nhalf the job market. The importance of mathematics for potential careers cannot be over\nemphasized. To get degrees in the following areas i.e. the Physical Sciences (Chemistry, Physics,\nEngineering), the life and health sciences (Biology, Psychology, Pharmacy, Nursing, Optometry),\nSocial Sciences, including Anthropology, Communications, Economics, Linguists, Education,\nGeography the Tech Sciences, like Computer Science, Networking, Software development,\nBusiness and Commerce Medicine, Actuarial science, used by insurance companies, one need\nto have good knowledge of Mathematics and Statistics.

      "content": "You should note that taking admission in the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS), you\nhave entered in a system where studying is different than in a formal school.\nYou Are a Self Learner Now\nIn a school, a teacher is always available to take classes, clarify doubts, guide and encourage.\nThere you also must be discussing with your peer-group, going to the library, doing practicals,\nparticipate in co-curricular activities, watching educational TV, Radio programmes etc. All this\nwas also contributing to your learning.\nHowever, in the NIOS, there is no teacher available and you have to learn on your own, It means\nthat you have become a self-learner. Responsibilities of a self-learner are much more than a\nnormal learner who is dependent on a teacher; but at the same time it is also challenging. Here it\nis solely you, who is responsible for your learning. It means that you have to organize your study,\nlearn regularly, keep up your motivation and achieve your goal.\nUnderstanding Your Learning Material\nThe NIOS will help you by providing learning material, part of which is in your hands at this\nmoment. We call them learning materials because these are different from the textbooks you\nhave read in your schools. Here the textbooks and the teachers have been put together. You will\nfind that the contents, concepts and topics have been explained here in a way the teacher does in\na classroom. You will also find examples and illustrations to help you understand the things\nproperly.\nThis is the reason you will find them bulky, but let this shall not frighten you. You will find a few\nsections in your lessons. Let us know the purpose of these:\nIntroduction:It introduces the topic to you.\nObjectives:Here you will find the list of objectives, which you shall achieve after\nlearning the lesson. You can actually check whether or not you have achieved these\nbecause these are presented in measurable terms.\nCheck Your Progress:These will appear after every section of the lesson. They will\ncontain objective, very short answer, short answer and long answer type questions\nbased on each lesson. This will help you to find whether you have learnt the section or\nnot. Your will find the key to these questions at the end of the lesson. If you are able\nto answer the questions, then you can proceed further otherwise you should learn the\nsection again.\nLet us Sum up:Here you will find the summary of the main concepts of the lesson\nfor recapitulation and revision.\nTerminal Exercise:Here short answer and long answer type questions are given to\nhelp you enhance your learning and give you an opportunity to practice for examination.\nAnswers:Answers of all “Check Your Progress” and “Terminal Exercise” are given\nat the end of each lesson. Some hints are also given in case of difficult questions.\nApart from the learning material, you will also get, sample papers, previous year\nquestion papers, etc., for help in your studies and for practice for examination.\nHow to Use the Study Materials\nC\nA\n1\n%\n+"

You should, however, note that\nthose are not meant for teaching you as it happens in a normal school. Here you will have an\nopportunity to clarify your doubts, solve your problems and get guidance and advice on your\nstudy. So go to the classes well prepared to get maximum benefit.\nUse of Audio and Video Programmes\nNIOS has also developed a few audio and video programmes, which will be very interesting for\nyou and will help you in your studies. You can take copies of this from your Center.\nPlanning and Organizing Your Study\nLet me also give you some tips for planning and organizing your study.\nFirst of all, you need to understand that there is no substitute for hard work. Harder you work\nbetter you achieve. Also, there are no short cuts to success. If someone has given you assurance\nof helping you in passing, then that will not work as there will be strict checking and vigilance in\nthe exam. Even if you are able to get through somehow, you will not gain any learning. So in order\nto succeed in an honest way and get benefit of your learning in your life, you need to learn.\nAs you must have understood by now, the NIOS provides a lot of freedom and flexibilities in\nyour study. For example, there is no need to take examination in all the subjects simultaneously.\nSo, first of all, think about the time available with you and decide whether you wish to study all\nthe subjects together or you wish to learn them one after the other. Just gambling in all the\nsubjects will bring you to a situation where you will not be able concentrate on any subject.\nNow fix up a time for study, evening, morning or daytime whichever is convenient Draw a\ntimetable giving justified time to the subjects you have taken up for study and follow this as far as\npossible. While you study, underline the concepts you feel are important. You should study from\nNIOS learning material. In addition you may read other-books, if you have time. However, for\nyour purpose, this material will be sufficient. Keep a copy each for the subjects you are preparing.\nNote down the points you did not understand. Discuss these with your parents, friends or teachers\nat the centres.\nSolve all the exercises, and practice exercises of each module appearing in the material. This\nwill not only help you in learning, but also provide practice for your examination. You may also\nlike to solve sample papers and previous years’ question papers. Show your answers to your\nparents and friends and discuss with them.\nThese were a few hints to help you. You may find some other techniques which may work\nbetter with you. Follow those, if you like. I am sure you will be successful in your endeavor."

      "content": "NIOS  Curriculum  for  Senior  Secondary  Course\nCURRICULUM OF SENIOR SECONDARY COURSE\nIN MATHEMATICS (311)\n1.RATIONALE\nMathematics is an important discipline of learning at the Senior Secondary stage. It helps the learner in\nacquiring decision making ability through its applications to real life both in familiar and unfamiliar situations.\nIt predominantly contributes to the development of precision, rational reasoning and analytical thinking. In\nthe Senior Secondary stage is most crucial where learners for the first time move towards diversification.\nAt this stage, the learners start thinking to take important decisions concerning their future career by\nchoosing suitable courses. It is the stage, from where learners would either go for higher academic education\nin Mathematics or for Professional courses or it may be the end of their academic career. One of the basic\naims of learning Mathematics at Senior Secondary level is to be developed problem solving skills and\nquantificational experiences around the learners. It includes a way of doing things, and the ability and\nattitude to formulate and solve problems (NCF, 2005). The idea is to allow the learner to realize how and\nwhy Mathematics is all around us. In view of these facts, it is important to make Mathematics Education at\nthis level broad based and meaningful. The revised curriculum in Mathematics has been designed to meet\nthe needs of diversity of learners. The contents and design of the revised curriculum broadly based on the\ncommon curriculum suggested by Council of Boards of School Education in India (COBSE). In order to\nrelate Mathematics to real life and work situations of NIOS learners, greater emphasis has been put on\napplications of various concepts.\n2.OBJECTIVES\nThe main objectives of learning Mathematics at Senior Secondary level are to enables the learners to:\nacquire knowledge and understanding of basic concepts, facts, principles, terms, symbols and\nprocesses of Mathematics.\nacquire the skills of quantification of experiences around them and make linkage with their life.\narticulate logically and use the same to prove results.\nconvert the word problems in the mathematical forms and solve them.\nintroduce learners to different ways of processing the given data and help them in arriving at\nconclusions\nprovide learners with an appreciation of the wide variety of application of Mathematics and equip\nthem with the basic device that enable such application\ndevelop appreciation for the influence and exquisiteness of Mathematics for its applications in\nScience, Commerce, Economics and daily life\napply mathematical knowledge and skills to solve variety problems.\ndevelop positive attitude towards Mathematics and its application.\n3.COURSE STRUCTURE:\nThe present curriculum in Mathematics has been distributed into two parts and ten modules. Part-1 consists\nof five modules namely as: Sets; Relation and Function; Sequences and Series; Algebra-I; Co-ordinate\nGeometry; Statistics and Probability. Similarly five modules are inside the Part-2 namely as:  Algebra-II;\nRelations and Functions; Calculus; Vectors and Three Dimensional Geometry; Linear Programming and\nMathematical Reasoning.  Each module has been divided further into different lessons.\nThe number of Lesson and suggested study time allotted for each module is as follows:\nMathematics (311)\ni"

Mr.\nMehta purchased the following objects/items. \"a toy, one kg sweets and a magazine\". Where as\nMrs. Mehta purchased the following objects/items. \"Lady fingers, Potatoes and Tomatoes\".\nIn both the examples, objects in each collection are well defined. What can you say about the\ncollection of students who speak the truth ? Is it well defined? Perhaps not. A set is a collection\nof well defined objects. For a collection to be a set it is necessary that it should be well defined.\nThe word well defined was used by the German Mathematician George Cantor (1845- 1918\nA.D) to define a set. He is known as father of set theory. Now-a-days set theory has become\nbasic to most of the concepts in Mathematics. In this lesson we shall discuss some basic definitions\nand operations involving sets.\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to :\ndefine a set and represent the same in different forms;\ndefine different types of sets such as, finite and infinite sets, empty set, singleton set,\nequivalent sets, equal sets, sub sets and cite examples thereof;\ndefine and cite examples of universal set, complement of a set and difference between\ntwo sets;\ndefine union and intersection of two sets;\nrepresent union and intersection of two sets, universal set, complement of a set, difference\nbetween two sets by Venn Diagram;\n  EXPECTED  BACKGROUND  KNOWLEDGE\nNumber systems,\n 1.1  SOME  STANDARD  NOTATIONS\nBefore defining different terms of this lesson let us consider the following examples:\nSETS\n1\nOBJECTIVES"

It can be written in the symbolic form as \n2    N\n and \n2    N \n.\n  1.  2  REPRESENTATION  OF A  SET\nThere are two methods to represent a set.\n1.2.1 (i) Roster method (Tabular form)\nIn this method a set is represented by listing all its elements, separating them by commas and\nenclosing them in curly bracket.\nIf V be the set of vowels of English alphabet, it can be written in  Roster form as :\nV = { a, e, i, o, u}\n(ii)If A be the set of natural numbers less than 7. then\nA={1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, is in the Roster form.\nNote : To write a set in Roster form elements are not to be repeated i.e. all elements are taken\nas distinct. For example if A be the set of letters used in the word mathematics, then\nA = {m, a, t, h, e, i, c, s}\n1.2.2 Set-builder form\nIn this form elements of the set are not listed but these are represented by some common property.\nLet V be the set of vowels of English alphabet then V can be written in the set builder form as:\nV = {x : x is a vowel of English alphabet}\n(ii)Let A be the set of natural numbers less than 7. then  A = {x : x \n\n  N and \nx    7}\n  Note : Symbol ':' read as 'such that'\n Example: 1.1   Write the following in set -builder form :\n(a)A={\n3,   2,   1, 0,1, 2, 3    \n}(b) B = {3,6,9,12}\nSolution : (a)A = {\nx : xZ and3    x   3   \n}\n(b)    B = {\nx : x    3n and nN, n    4    \n}\n Example: 1.2  Write the following in Roster form.\n(a) C = {\nx : xN and 50x60  \n}\n(b) D = \n\n2\nx : x   R and x5 x   6   0    \nSolution :(a) C ={50, 51, 52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60}\n(b) \n2\nx5 x   6   0    "

Therefore this\nset consists of no element. Similiarly there is no such number which is less than 5 and greater\nthan 7. Such a set is said to be a null (empty) set. It is denoted by the symbol \n\n or { }\nA set which has no element is said to be a null/empty/void set, and is denoted  by \n\n. or {}\n1.3.3 Singleton Set :Consider the following set :\nA = {x : x is an even prime number}\nAs there is only one even prime number namely 2, so set A will have only one element. Such a\nset is said to be singleton. Here A = \n\n2\n.\nA set which has only one element is known as singleton.\n1.3.4 Equal and equivalent sets : Consider the following examples.\n(i)A = \n\n1, 2, 3\n,   B = \n\n2,1, 3\n(ii)D = \n\n1, 2, 3\n,   E = \n\na, b, c\n.\nIn example (i) Sets A and B have the same elements. Such sets are said to be equal sets and\nit is written as A = B. In example (ii) sets D and E have the same number of elements but\nelements are different. Such sets are said to be equivalent sets and are written as A \n\n B.\nTwo sets A and B are said to be equivalent sets if they have same number of elements but they\nare said to be equal if they have not only the same number of elements but elements are also the\nsame.\n1.3.5 Disjoint Sets : Two sets are said to be disjoint if they do not have any common element.\nFor example,sets A= { 1,3,5} and B = { 2,4,6 } are disjoint sets."

An angle is formed by the rotation\nof a ray as well.

In a unit circle one radian will be the angle subtended at the centre\nof the circle by an arc of unit length.\nFig. 3.2\nNote :  A radian is a constant angle; implying that the measure of the angle subtended by\nan are of a circle, with length equal to the radius is always the same irrespective of the\nradius of the circle.\n3.1.3 Relation between Degree and Radian\nAn arc of unit length subtends an angle of 1 radian.

P.\nThe difference between two consecutive terms is called the common defference of the A. P.\nand is denoted by 'd'.\nIn  general,  an  A.  P.  whose  first  term  is a  and  common  difference  is d  is  written  as\na, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, \n\nAlso we use t\nn\n to denote the nth term of the progression.\n6.2.1 GENERAL TERM OF AN A. P.\nLet us consider A. P. a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, \n\nHere, first term (t\n1\n) = a\nsecond term (t\n2\n) = a + d = a + (2 – 1) d,\nthird term (t\n3\n) = a + 2d = a + (3 – 1) d\nBy observing the above pattern, n\nth\n term can be written as: t\nn\n = a + (n – 1) d\nHence, if the first term and the common difference of an A. P. are known then any term of\nA. P. can be determined by the above formula.\nNote.:\n(i) If the same non-zero number is added to each term of an A. P. the resulting sequence\n is again an A. P.\n(ii) If each term of an A. P. is multiplied by the same non-zero number, the resulting\n sequence is again an A. P.\n Example 6.1    Find the 10\nth\n term of the A. P.:  2, 4, 6, ...\nSolution : Here the first term (a) = 2 and common difference d = 4 – 2 = 2\nUsing the formula t\nn\n = a + (n – 1) d, we have\nt\n10\n = 2 + (10 – 1) 2 = 2 + 18 = 20\nHence, the 10th term of the given A. P. is 20.\n Example 6.2    The 10\nth\n term of an A. P. is – 15 and 31\nst \n term is –57, find the 15\nth\n term.\nSolution : Let a be the first term and d be the common difference of the A. P. Then from the\nformula: t\nn\n = a + (n – 1) d, we have\nt\n10\n = a + (10 – 1) d = a + 9d and t\n31\n = a + (31 – 1) d = a + 30 d"

Thus,  we  extended  our  number  system  to  whole  numbers  and\nintegers.\nTo  solve  the  problems  of  the  type \npq\n  we  included  rational  numbers  in  the  system  of\nintegers.  The  system  of  rational  numbers  has  been  extended  further  to  irrational  numbers\nas  all  lengths  cannot  be  measured  in  terms  of  lengths  expressed  in  rational  numbers.\nRational  and  irrational  numbers  taken  together  are  termed  as  real  numbers.    But  the\nsystem  of  real  numbers  is  not  sufficient  to  solve  all  algebraic  equations.  There  are  no\nreal  numbers  which  satisfy  the  equation  x\n2\n+1  =  0  or  x\n2\n  = 1.  In  order  to  solve  such\nequations,  i.e.,  to  find  square  roots  of  negative  numbers,  we  extend  the  system  of  real\nnumbers  to  a  new  system  of  numbers  known  as  complex  numbers.  In  this  lesson  the\nlearner  will  be  acquinted  with  complex  numbers,  its  representation  and  algebraic\noperations  on  complex  numbers.\n  OBJECTIVES\nAfter  studying  this  lesson,  you  will  be  able  to:\ndescribe  the  need  for  extending  the  set  of  real  numbers  to  the  set  of  complex\nnumbers;\ndefine  a  complex  number  and  cite  examples;\nidentify  the  real  and  imaginary  parts  of  a  complex  number;\nstate  the  condition  for  equality  of  two  complex  numbers;\nrecognise  that  there  is  a  unique  complex  number x  +  iy    associated  with  the    point\nP(x,  y)  in  the Argand  Plane  and  vice-versa;\ndefine  and  find  the  conjugate  of  a  complex  number;\ndefine  and  find  the  modulus  and  argument  of  a  complex  number;\nrepresent  a  complex  number  in  the  polar  form;\nperform  algebraic  operations  (addition,  subtraction,  multiplication  and  division)  on\ncomplex  numbers;\nstate  and  use  the  properties  of  algebraic  operations  (  closure,  commutativity,\nassociativity,  identity,  inverse  and  distributivity)  of  complex  numbers;  and\n8"

Euler  named  a  number  'i'  as Iota  whose  square  is\n1.  This Iota  or  'i' is  defined  as  imaginary  unit.  With  the  introduction  of  the  new\nsymbol 'i',  we  can  interpret  the  square  root  of  a  negative  number  as  a  product  of  a  real\nnumber  with  i.\nTherefore,  we  can  denote  the  solution  of  (A)  as  x  =  ±  i\nThus,  –4  =  4(–1)\n22\n4(  1)(4).22ii    \nConventionally  written  as  2i.\nSo,  we  have\n42i,\n           \n77i \n47,\n are all examples of complex numbers.\nConsider  another  quadratic  equation:  x\n2\n  –6x  +  13  =  0\nThis  can  be  solved  as  under:\n(x  –3)\n2\n  +  4  =  0  or,  (x  –3)\n2\n \n=  –4\nor,x  –  3  =  ±  2i  or,  x  =  3  ±  2i"

It is called a quadratic equation in x.  The coefficient ‘a’ is the first or\nleading coefficient, ‘b’ is the second or middle coefficient and ‘c’ is the  constant term (or third\ncoefficient). For example,  7x² + 2x + 5  = 0,  \n2\n5\nx² + \n2\n1\nx + 1 = 0,\n3x² \n\n x = 0,  x² + \n2\n1\n = 0, \n2\nx² + 7x = 0, are all quadratic equations.\nSome times, it is not possible to translate a word problem in the form of an equation. Let us\nconsider the following situation:\nAlok goes to market with Rs. 30 to buy pencils. The cost of one pencil is Rs. 2.60. If x denotes\nthe number of pencils which he buys, then he will spend an amount of Rs. 2.60x. This amount\ncannot be equal to Rs. 30 as x is a natural number. Thus.\n2.60 x < 30... (i)\nLet us consider one more situation where a person wants to buy chairs and tables with Rs.\n50,000 in hand. A table costs Rs. 550 while a chair costs Rs. 450. Let x be the number of\nchairs   and    y   be   t he   nu mber    o f   t ables   he   buys,    t he n   his   t o t al   co st    =\nRs.(550 x + 450 y)\nThus, in this case we can write, 550x + 450y < 50,000\nor11x + 9y \n\n 1000... (ii)\nStatement (i) involves the sign of inequality  ‘<’ and statement (ii) consists of two statements:\n11x+9y < 1000, 11x+9y = 1000 in which the first one is not an equation: Such statements are\ncalled Inequalities. In this lesson, we will discuss linear inequalities and their solution.\nWe will also discuss how to solve quadratic equations with real and complex coefficients and\nestablish relation between roots and coefficients.\n      OBJECTIVES\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to:\nsolve a quadratic equation with real coefficients by factorization and by using quadratic\nformula;"

For instance, if you are told that your friend just has a child, you would know\nthat it is either a girl or a boy. In this case, you would be applying general principles to a\nparticular case. This form of reasoning is an example of deductive logic.\nNow let us consider another situation. When you look around, you find students who study\nregularly, do well in examinations, you may formulate the general rule (rightly or wrongly) that\n“any one who studies regularly will do well in examinations”. In this case, you would be formulating\na general principle (or rule) based on several particular instances. Such reasoning is inductive, a\nprocess of reasoning by which general rules are discovered by the observation and consideration\nof several individual cases. Such reasoning is used in all the sciences, as well as in Mathematics.\nMathematical induction is a more precise form of this process. This precision is required because\na statement is accepted to be true mathematically only if it can be shown to be true for each and\nevery case that it refers to.\nIn the present chapter, first of all we shall introduce you with a statement and then we shall\nintroduce the concept of principale of Mathematical induction, which we shall be using in proving\nsome statements.\n      OBJECTIVES\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to:\nTo check whether the given sentence is a statement or not.\nstate the Principle of Mathematical Induction;\nverify the truth or otherwise of the statement P(n) for n = 1;\nverify P(k+1) is true, assuming that P(k) is true;\nuse principle of mathematical induction to establish the truth or otherwise of mathematical\nstatements;\n  EXPECTED  BACKGROUND  KNOWLEDGE\nNumber System\nFour fundamental operations on numbers and expressions."

Of\nthese assertions, the ones that are either true or false are called statement or propositions.\nFor instance,\n“I am 20 years old” and “If x = 3, then x\n2\n = 9” are statements, but ‘When will you leave ?’ And\n‘How wonderful!’ are not statements.\nNotice that a statement has to be a definite assertion which can be true or false, but not both.\nFor example, ‘x - 5 = 7’ is not a statement, because we don't know what x, is. If x = 12, it is\ntrue, but if x = 5, ‘it is not true. Therefore, ‘x – 5 = 7’ is not accepted by mathematicians as a\nstatement.\nBut both ‘x – 5 = 7  x = 12’ and x – 5 = 7 for any real number x’ are statements, the first one\ntrue and the second one false.\n Example 10.1   Which of the following sentences is a statement ?\n(i) India has never had a woman President. , (ii) 5 is an even number.\n(iii) x\nn \n> 1 , (iv) (a + b)\n2 \n= a\n2 \n+ 2ab + b\n2\nSolution : (i) and (ii) are statements, (i) being true and (ii) being false. (iii) is not a statement,\nsince we can not determine whether it is true or false, unless we know the range of values that\nx and n can take.\nNow look at (iv).  At first glance , you may say that it is not a statement, for the very same\nreasons that (iii) is not. But look at (iv) carefully. It is true for any value of a and b. It is an\nidentity. Therefore, in this case, even though we have not specified the range of values for a and\nb, (iv) is a statement.\nSome statements, like the one given below are about natural numbers in general. Let us look at\nthe statement :\n12\n1\n2\n\n\n...\n()\nn\nnn\nThis involves a general natural number n. Let us call this statement P (n) [P stands for proposition].\nThen P (1) would be \n1(1   1)\n1\n2\n\n\nSimilarly, P (2) would be the statement , \n2(2   1)\n1   2\n2\n\n  \n and so on.\nLet us look at some examples to help  you get used to this notation.\n Example 10.2   If P (n) denotes \n2\nn\n> n–1, write P (1), P (k) and  P  (k+1), where \nkN\n.\nSolution : Replacing n by 1, k and k + 1, respectively in P (n), we get"

One effective method is mathematical induction,\nwhich we shall now discuss.\n   10.2 The Principle of Mathematical Induction:\nLet P(n) be a statement involving a natural number n. If\n(i) it is true for n = 1, i.e., P(1) is true; and\n(ii) assuming k\n\n 1 and P(k) to be true, it can be proved that  P(k+ 1) is true; then\nP(n) must be true for every natural number n.\nNote that condition (ii) above does not say that P(k) is true. It says that whenever P(k)\nis true, then P( k + 1) is true’.\nLet us see, for example, how the principle of mathematical induction allows us to conclude that\nP(n) is true forn = 11.\nBy (i) P(1) is true. As P(1) is true, we can put k = 1 in (ii), So P(1 + 1), i.e., P(2) is true. As\nP(2)     is    t rue ,    we     can    put  k    =  2    in    ( ii)    and    co nclud e    t hat\nP(2 + 1), i.e., P(3) is true. Now put k = 3 in (ii), so we get that P(4) is true. It is now clear that\nif we continue like this, we shall get that P(11) is true.\nIt is also clear that in the above argument, 11 does not play any special role. We can prove that\nP(137) is true in the same way. Indeed, it is clear that P(n) is true for all n > 1.\n Example 10.4   Prove that, \n1   2   3(1)\n2\nn\nnn           \n, where n is a natural number..\nSolution: We have  , P(n) : 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = \nn\n2\n(n + 1)\nTherefore, P(1) is ‘1 = \n1\n2\n(1+1)’, which is true,. Therefore, P(1) is true.\nLet us now see, is P(k + 1) true whenever P(k) is true."

There is no direct train from\nBangalore to Allahabad, but there are trains from Bangalore to Itarsi and from Itarsi to Allahabad.\nFrom the railway timetable I found that there are two trains from Bangalore to Itarsi and three\ntrains from Itarsi to Allahabad. Now, in how many ways can I travel from Bangalore to Allahabad?\nThere  are counting  problems  which  come  under  the  branch  of  Mathematics  called\ncombinatorics.\nSuppose you have five jars of spices that you want to arrange on a shelf in your kitchen. You\nwould like to arrange the jars, say three of them, that you will be using often in a more accessible\nposition and the remaining two jars in a less accessible position. In this situation the order of jars\nis important. In how many ways can you do it?\nIn another situation suppose you are painting your house. If a particular shade or colour is not\navailable, you may be able to create it by mixing different colours and shades. While creating\nnew colours this way, the order of mixing is not important. It is the combination or choice of\ncolours that determine the new colours; but not the order of mixing.\nTo give another similar example, when you go for a journey, you may not take all your dresses\nwith you. You may have 4 sets of shirts and trousers, but you may take only 2 sets. In such a\ncase you are choosing 2 out of 4 sets and the order of choosing the sets doesn’t matter. In these\nexamples, we need to find out the number of choices in which it can be done.\nIn this lesson we shall consider simple counting methods and use them in solving such simple\ncounting problems.\n      OBJECTIVES\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to :\nfind out the number of ways in which a given number of objects can be arranged;\nstate the Fundamental Principle of Counting;\ndefine n! and evaluate it for defferent values of n;\nstate that permutation is an arrangement and write the meaning of \nn\nr\nP\n;\nstate that \n!\n()!\nn\nr\nn\nP\nn    r\n\n\n and apply this to solve problems;"

We will write t\n1\n, t\n2\n to denote trains\nfrom Bangalore to Itarsi and T\n1\n, T\n2\n, T\n3\n, for the trains from Itarsi to Allahabad. Suppose I take\nt\n1\n to travel from Bangalore to Itarsi. Then from Itarsi I can take T\n1 \nor T\n2\n or T\n3\n. So the possibilities\nare t\n1\nT\n1\n, t\n1\nT\n2\n and t\n1\nT\n3\n where t\n1\nT\n1\n denotes travel from Bangalore to Itarsi by t\n1\n and travel from\nItarsi to Allahabad by T\n1\n. Similarly, if I take t\n2\n to travel from Bangalore to Itarsi, then the\npossibilities are t\n2\nT\n1\n, t\n2\nT\n2\n and t\n2\nT\n3\n. Thus, in all there are \n6 (2   3)\npossible ways of travelling\nfrom Bangalore to Allahabad.\nHere we had a small number of trains and thus could list all possibilities. Had there been 10\ntrains from Bangalore to Itarsi and 15 trains from Itarsi to Allahabad, the task would have been\nvery tedious. Here the Fundamental Principle of Counting or simply the Counting Principle\ncomes in use :\nIf any event can occur in m ways and after it happens in any one of these ways, a\nsecond event can occur in n ways, then both the events together can occur in \nnm\nways.\n Example 11.1   How many multiples of 5 are there from 10 to 95 ?\nSolution : As you know, multiples of 5 are integers having 0 or 5 in the digit to the extreme right\n(i.e. the unit’s place).\nThe first digit from the right can be chosen in 2 ways.\nThe second digit can be any one of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\ni.e. There are 9 choices for the second digit.\nThus, there are \n1892\n multiples of 5 from 10 to 95."

If you have only one book, there is only\none way of arranging it. Suppose you have two books, one of History and one of Geography.\nYou can arrange the Geography and History books in two ways. Geography book first and the\nHistory book next, GH or History book first and Geography book next; HG. In other words,\nthere are two arrangements of the two books.\nNow, suppose you want to add a Mathematics book also to the shelf.

As we will see shortly, the\nformula given in Equation 11.7 will be useful for proving certain properties of \nr\nn\nC\n.\nrn\nn\nr\nn\nCC\n\n\n  ...(11.8)\nThis means just that the number of ways of choosing r objects out of n objects is the same as\nthe number of ways of not choosing (n – r) objects out of n objects. In the example described\nin the introduction, it just means that the number of ways of selecting 2 sets of dresses is the\nsame as the number of ways of rejecting 4 – 2 = 2 dresses. In Example 11.20, this means that\nthe number of ways of choosing subsets with 4 elements is the same as the number of ways of\nrejecting 8 elements since choosing a particular subset of 4 elements is equivalent to rejecting\nits complement, which has 8 elements.\nLet us now prove this relation using Equation 11.7. The denominator of the right hand side of\nthis equation is r! (n – r)!. This does not change when we replace r by n – r.\n()!.[()]!

Using this formula, we get, for example, \n100\nC\n98\n is the same as\n100\nC\n2\n. The second value is much more easier to calculate than the first one.\n Example 11.27   Evaluate :\n(a)  \n5\n7\nC\n(b)  \n9\n11\nC\n(c)  \n9\n10\nC\n(d)  \n9\n12\nC\nSolution : (a) From relation 11.8, we have\n21\n2.1\n6.7\n2\n7\n57\n7\n5\n7\n\n\nCCC\n(b) Similarly\n10\n1\n10\n910\n10\n9\n10\n\n\nCCC"

Or suppose we\nneed to find the size of the population of a country after 10 years if we know the annual growth\nrate. A result that will help in finding these quantities is the binomial theorem. This theorem, as\nyou will see, helps us to calculate positive integral powers of any real binomial expression, that\nis, any expression involving two terms.\nThe binomial theorem, was known to Indian and Greek mathematicians in the 3rd century B.C.\nfor some cases. The credit for the result for natural exponents goes to the Arab poet and\nmathematician Omar Khayyam (A.D. 1048-1122). Further generalisation to rational exponents\nwas done by the British mathematician Newton (A.D. 1642-1727).\nThere was a reason for looking for further generalisation, apart from mathematical interest. The\nreason was its many applications. Apart from the ones we mentioned at the beginning, the\nbinomial theorem has several applications in probability theory, calculus, and in approximating\nnumbers like (1.02)\n7\n, etc. We shall discuss them in this lesson.\n      OBJECTIVES\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to:\nstate the binomial theorem for a positive integral index and prove it using the principle of\nmathematical induction;\nwrite the binomial expansion for expressions like \n()\nn\nx    y\n for different values of x and y\nusing binomial theorem;\nwrite the general term and middle term (s) of a binomial expansion;\n  EXPECTED  BACKGROUND  KNOWLEDGE\nNumber System\nFour fundamental operations on numbers and expressions.\nAlgebraic expressions and their simplifications.\nIndices and exponents.\n12.1 THE BINOMIAL THEOREM FOR A NATURAL EXPONENT\nYou must have multiplied a binomial by itself, or by another binomial.

If you look closely at these expansions, you would\nalso observe the following:\n1.The number of terms in the expansion is one more than the exponent of the binomial. For\nexample, in the expansion of (x + y)\n4 \n, the number of terms is 5.\n2.The exponent of x in the first term is the same as the exponent of the binomial, and the\nexponent decreases by 1 in each successive term of the expansion.\n3.The exponent of y in the first term is zero (as y\n0 \n= 1). The exponent of y in the second term\nis 1, and it increases by 1 in each successive term till it becomes the exponent of the\nbinomial in the last term of the expansion.\n4.The sum of the exponents of x and y in each term is equal to the exponent of the binomial.\nFor example, in the expansion of (x + y)\n5\n, the sum of the exponents of x and y in each\nterm is 5.\nIf we use the combinatorial co-efficients, we can write the expansion as\n(x + y)\n3 \n= \n3\nC\n0\n x\n3\n + \n3\nC\n1\nx\n2\ny + \n3\nC\n2\nx y\n2\n + \n3\nC\n3 \ny\n3\n(x + y)\n4\n = \n4\nC\n0\nx\n4\n + \n4\nC\n1\nx\n3\ny + \n4\nC\n2\nx\n2\ny\n2\n + \n4\nC\n3\nxy\n3\n + \n4\nC\n4 \ny\n4\n(x + y)\n5\n = \n5\nC\n0\nx\n5\n + \n5\nC\n1\nx\n4\ny + \n5\nC\n2\nx\n3\ny\n2\n + \n5\nC\n3\nx\n2\ny\n3\n + \n5\nC\n4\nxy\n4\n + \n5\nC\n5 \ny\n5\n, and so on.\nMore generally, we can write the binomial expansion of (x + y)\nn\n, where n is a positive\ninteger, as given in the following theorem.

For example, seat\nH-4 means the fourth seat in the H\nth \n row. In other words, H and 4 are the coordinates of your\nseat. Thus, the geometrical concept of location is represented by numbers and alphabets (an\nalgebraic concept).\nAlso a road map gives us the location of various houses (again numbered in a particular se-\nquence), roads and parks in a colony, thus representing algebraic concepts by geometrical\nfigures like straight lines, circles and polygons.\nThe study of that branch of Mathematics which deals with the interrelationship between geo-\nmetrical and algebraic concepts is called Coordinate Geometry or Cartesian Geometry in honour\nof the famous French mathematician Rene Descartes.\nIn this lesson we shall study the basics of coordinate geometry and relationship between con-\ncept of straight line in geometry and its algebraic representation.\n      OBJECTIVES\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to:\ndefine  Cartesian  System  of  Coordinates  including  the  origin,  coordinate  axes,\nquadrants, etc;\nderive distance formula and section formula;\nderive the formula for area of a triangle with given vertices;\nverify the collinearity of three given points;\nstate the meaning of the terms : inclination and slope of a line;\nfind the formula for the slope of a line through two given points;\nstate the condition for parallelism and perpendicularity of lines with given slopes;\nfind the intercepts made by a line on coordinate axes;\nfind the angle between two lines when their slopes are given;\nfind the coordinates of a point when origin is shifted to some other point;\nfind transformed equation of curve when oregin is shifted to another point."

The fixed\npoint O,where these lines intersect each other is\ncalled the origin O as shown in Fig. 13.1 These\nmutually  perpencular  lines  are  called  the\ncoordinate axes. The horizontal line XOX' is\nthe x-axis or axis of x and the vertical line YOY'\nis the y- axis  or axis of y.\n9.1.1CARTESIAN COORDINATES OF\nA POINT\nTo find the coordinates of a point we proceed\nas follows. Take X'OX and YOY' as coordinate\naxes. Let P be any point in this plane. From point\nP draw \n'\nPAXOX\nand \n'\n.PBYOY\n Then the\ndistance OA = x measured along x-axis and the\ndistance  OB  =  y  measured  along  y-axis\ndetermine  the  position  of  the  point  P  with\nreference  to  these  axes.  The  distance  OA\nmeasured  along  the  axis  of  x  is  called  the\nabscissa or x-coordinate and the distance OB\n(=PA)  measured  along  y\n\naxis  is  called  the\nordinate or y-coordinate of the point P. The\nabscissa and the ordinate taken together are\ncalled the coordinates of the point P. Thus, the\ncoordinates of the point P are (x and y) which\nrepresent the position of the point P point in a\nplane.  These  two  numbers  are  to  form  an\nordered pair beacuse the order in which we\nwrite these numbers is important.\nx\nx'\ny\ny'\nFig. 9.2\nOA\nBP  x y (  ,  )\nx\nx'\ny\ny'\nFig. 13.1\nO\nFig. 13.1\nFig. 13.2"

Since the carrot\nis conical in shape so the section formed are sections of a cone. They are therefore called conic\nsections.\nMathematically,  a  conic  section  is  the  locus  of  a  point  P  which  moves  so  that  its\ndistance from a fixed point is always in a constant ratio to its perpendicular distance\nfrom a fixed line.\nThe fixed point is called the focus and is usually denoted by S.\nThe fixed straight line is called the Directrix.\nThe straight line passing through the focus and perpendicular to the directrix is called the axis.\nThe constant ratio is called the eccentricity and is denoted by e.\nWhat happens when\n(i)  \n1e\n(ii)  \n1e\n(iii)  \n1e\nIn these cases the  conic section obtained are known as  ellipse, parabola and hyperbola\nrespectively.\nIn this lesson we shall study about ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola.\n  16.2  ELLIPSE\nRecall the cutting of slices of a carrot. When we cut it obliquely, slanting without letting the knife\npass through the base, what do we observe?\nYou might have come across such shapes when you cut a boiled egg vertically.\nThe slice thus obtained represents an ellipse. Let us define the ellipse mathematically as follows:\n“An ellipse is the locus of a point which moves in a plane such that its distance\nfrom a fixed point bears a constant ratio to its distance from a fixed line and this\nratio is less than unity”.\n16.2.1 STANDARD EQUATION OF AN ELLIPSE\nLet S be the focus, ZK be the directrix and P be a moving point. Draw SK perpendicular from\nS on the directrix. Let e be the eccentricity.\nDivide SK internally and externally at A and A' (on KS produced) repectively in the ratio e : 1,\nas e<1."

For this, coefficient of variation (C.V.) is obtained\nwhich is defined as\nC.V.  = \n100,0x\nx\n\n\nwhere  and \nx\n are standard deviation and mean of the data. The coefficients of variation\nare compared to compare the variability of two series. The series with greater C.V. is said\nto be more variable than the other.

Tossing of a coin is an activity and getting either a 'Head' or a \"Tail' are two possible\noutcomes. (Assuming that the coin does not stand on the edge). If we throw a die (of course fair\ndie) the possible outcomes of this activity could be any one of its faces having numerals, namely\n1,2,3,4,5 and 6..... at the top face.\nAn activity that yields a result or an outcome is called an experiment. Normally there are variety of\noutcomes of an experiment and it is a matter of chance as to which one of these occurs when an\nexperiment is performed. In this lesson, we propose to study various experiments and their outcomes.\nOBJECTIVES\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to :\nexplain the meaning of a random experiments and cite examples thereof;\nexplain the role of chance in such random experiments;\ndefine a sample space corresponding to an experiment;\nwrite a sample space corresponding to a given experiment; and\ndifferentiate between various types of events such as equally likely, mutually exclusive,\nexhaustive, independent and dependent events.\n  EXPECTED  BACKGROUND  KNOWLEDGE\nBasic concepts of probability\n  18.1  RANDOM  EXPERIMENT\nLet us consider the following activities :\n(i)Toss a coin and note the outcomes.

Kings, Queens and Jacks are called face cards and\nthe other cards are called number cards.\n  19.1  EVENTS AND THEIR  PROBABILITY\nIn the previous lesson, we have learnt whether an activity is a random experiment or not. The\nstudy of probability always refers to random experiments. Hence, from now onwards, the\nword experiment will be used for a random experiment only. In the preceeding lesson, we have\ndefined different types of events such as equally likely, mutually exclusive, exhaustive, indepen-\ndent and dependent events and cited examples of the above mentioned events.\nHere we are interested in the chance that a particular event will occur, when an experiment is\nperformed. Let us consider some examples.\nWhat are the chances of getting a ' Head' in tossing an unbiased coin ? There are only two\nequally likely outcomes, namely head and tail. In our day to day language, we say that the coin\nhas chance 1 in 2 of showing up a head. In technical language, we say that the probability of\ngetting a head is \n1\n2\n.\nSimilarly, in the experiment of rolling a die, there are six equally likely outcomes 1, 2,3,4,5 or 6.\nThe face with number '1' (say) has chance 1 in 6 of appearing on the top. Thus, we say that the\nprobability of getting 1 is \n1\n6\n.\nIn the above experiment, suppose we are interested in finding the probability of getting even\nnumber on the top, when a die is rolled. Clearly, the possible numbers are 2, 4 and 6 and the\nchance of getting an even number is 3 in 6. Thus, we say that the probability of getting an even\nnumber is \n3\n6\n,  i.e., \n1\n2\n.\nThe above discussion suggests the following definition of probability.\nIf an experiment with 'n' exhaustive, mutually exclusive and equally likely outcomes, m outcomes\nare favourable to the happening of an event A, the probability 'p' of happening of A is given by\n\nNumber of  favourable outcomes\nP   A\nTotal number of  possible outcomes\n\nm\np\nn\n....(i)\nSince the number of cases favourable to the non-happening of the event A are \nnm\n, the\nprobability  'q' that 'A' will not happen is given by\nnmm\nq1\nnn\n\n    \n1    p \n  [Using (i)]\n\npq1. "

For example, if a coin is tossed three times, we say that there are three trials\nof the tossing of the coin.\nA particular event may be called success of a trial. Clearly non-happening of the event may\nbe termed as a failure. For, example in throwing a die, if the occurrence of a number less\nthen 4 is named as success then the non-occurrence of a number less than 4 is named as\nfailure. Thus, each trial can have two outcomes namely, success or failure.\nTwo or more trials of a random experiment can be performed in two ways :\n1.The probability of success or failure remain constant in each trial. For example tossing\na coin n number of times, but in each trial probability of getting head is \n1\n2\n. Such trials\nare called independent trials.\n2.The probability of success/failure varies with each trial. For example in drawing card\nfrom a deck of cards one after the other without replacement, in such trials if success\nis taken to be drawing a card of spade, the probability of success in respective trials\nwill change.\ni.e.Trial1st2nd3rd, ...\nProbability\n13\n52\n12\n51\n11\n50\n,  ...\nThe trials of first type i.e. independent trials with two out comes success or failure are\ncalled Bernoulli trials.\nDefinition : Trials of a random experiment are called Bernoulli trials, if each trial has\nexactly two outcomes and trials are finite and independent.\n19.15  :  BINOMIAL  DISTRIBUTION\nThe probability distribution of number successes in Bernoulli trials of a random experiment\nmay be obtained by the expansion of (q + p)\nn\n where\np  =prob. of success in each trial\nq  =1 – p, = prob. of failure\nn  =number of trials"

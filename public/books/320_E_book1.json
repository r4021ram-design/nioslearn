Education  is  an  instrument  of\nchange. The right type of education at right time can bring about positivity in the\noutlook  of  society,  attitudinal  changes  to  face  the  new/fresh  challenges  and  the\ncourage to face difficult situations.\nThis can be very effectively achieved by the curriculum renewal at regular intervals\nof time. A static curriculum does not serve any purpose, as it does not cater to the\ncurrent needs and aspirations of the individual and society.\nFor  this  purpose  only,  educationists  from  all  over  the  country  come  together  at\nregular intervals to deliberate on the issues of changes needed and required. As an\noutcome  of  such  deliberations,  the  National  Curriculum  Framework  (NCF  2005)\ncame out, which spells out in detail the type of education desirable/needed at various\nlevels of education – primary, elementary, secondary or senior secondary.\nKeeping this framework and other national and societal concerns in mind, we have\ncurrently revised the curricula of Accountancy course at Senior Secondary Level, as\nper the Common Core Curriculum developed by COBSE (Council of Boards of School\nEducation) and NCERT (National Council for Educational Research and Training)\nmaking  it  current  and  need  based.  Textual  material  production  is  an  integral  and\nessential part of all NIOS programmes offered through open and distance learning\nsystem.  Therefore,  we  have  taken  special  care  to  make  the  learning  material  user\nfriendly,  interesting  and  attractive  for  you.\nI  would  like  to  thank  all  the  eminent  persons  involved  in  making  this  material\ninteresting and relevant to your needs.

When you buy these items, the store owner immediately opens\nthe page of a note book on which your father’s name is written. He records the value\nof items purchased. At the end of the month, your father goes to him. He again opens\nthe same page tells the total amount to be paid and records when your father makes the\npayment. In a similar manner, he keeps the record of other customers also. Whenever\nhe gets commodities from suppliers he records the same and also records the payment\nhe makes to them. Similarly, every business small or big, sole proprietor or a firm\nkeeps the record of the business transactions. Have you ever thought why do they\nkeep record of business transactions? If they do not keep the record how will they\nknow how much, when and to whom they have to make payments or from whom, how\nmuch and when they have to receive payments or what they have earned after a particular\nperiod and so on.

Can you estimate the number of\ntransactions a business undertakes? It depends upon the size of a business entity. Every\nday business transactions may be around hundreds/thousands. Can a businessman\nremember all these transactions in every respect? Not at all. So it becomes necessary\nto record these business transactions in details and in a systematic manner. Recording\nof business transactions in a systematic manner in the books of account is called book-\nkeeping. Book-Keeping is concerned with recording of financial data. This may be\ndefined as.\n“The art of keeping a permanent record of business transactions is\nbook-keepng”.\nFrom books of accounts important details such as total sales, total purchases, total\ncash receipts, total payments, etc. may be ascertained. As you know the main objective\nof business is to earn profits. In order to ascertain the profit earned during a period,\nmere recording of business transactions is not enough. Accounting involves not only\nbook keeping but also many other activities. In 1941, the American Institute of Certified\nPublic Accountants (AICPA) defined accounting as\n“The art of recording, classifying, summarising, analysing and\ninterpreting the business transactions systematically and communicating\nbusiness results to interested users in accounting”\nAccounting is identified with a system of recording of business transactions that create\neconomic information about business enterprises to facilitate decision making. The\nfunction of accounting is to provide quantitative information, primarily financial in nature,\nabout economic entities, that is intended to be useful in making economic decisions.\nThe American Accounting Association defined accounting as :\n“It is the process of identifying, measuring, recording and communicating the\nrequired information relating to the economic events of an organisation to the\ninterested users of such information.\nAccounting - An Introduction"

Purchase of\na Machinery, installing and keeping it ready for manufacturing is an economic event\nwhich consists of a number of financial transactions. These transactions are (a)\nbuying the machine, (b) transporting the same, (c) preparing the site for its installation\nand (d) incurring expenditure on installing the same.\nzIdentification, Measurement, Recording and Communication :\nIdentification implies determining what transactions are to be recorded i.e. items\nof financial character are to be recorded. For example, goods purchased for cash\nor on credit will be recorded. Items of non-financial character such as changes in\nmanagerial policies, etc. are not recorded in the books of accounts.\nMeasurement means quantification of business transactions into financial terms\nby using monetary unit. If an event cannot be quantified in monetary terms, it is not\nconsidered fit for recording in the books of the firm. That is why important items\nlike appointment, signing of contracts, etc. are not shown in the books of accounts.\nRecording : Having identified and measured the economic events in financial terms,\nthese are recorded in the books of accounts in monetary terms date wise. The\nrecording of the business transactions is done in such a manner that the necessary\nfinancial information is summarized according to well established accounting\npractices.\nCommunication : The economic events are identified, measured and recorded in\nsuch a manner that the necessary relevant information is generated and communicated\nin a certain form to the management and other internal and external users of\ninformation. The financial information is regularly communicated through accounting\nreports.\nzOrganisation : refers to a business enterprise whether for profit or not for profit\nmotive.\nzInterested users of information.

Accounting is often called the\n“Language of Business”. It is the common language used to communicate financial\ninformation to individuals, organisations, government agencies about various aspects\nof business such as financial position, operating results (i.e. Profit or loss) and cash\nflows. Users, both inside and outside the business, have to make decisions concerning\nthe allocation of limited economic resources. In order to ensure that resources are\nallocated in an efficient and effective manner, \nusers require financial information\nfor the purpose of making decisions. Accounting provides information that is useful in\nmaking business and economic decisions. It is the primary means of communicating\nfinancial information to owners, lenders, managers,. Government and its regulatory\nagencies ‘-and -others- who have interest in an enterprise. It helps the users in taking\nbetter decisions by providing relevant, reliable and timely information on the financial\nand operational position of an enterprise.\nIt is observed that almost all business enterprises maintain detailed accounting records.\nEven the most intelligent manager with a sharp memory would find it difficult to remember\nthe daily transactions simply by observing them. So he/she must rely upon the accounting\nprocess which begins with the recording of business transactions and ends up with the\npreparation of summarized financial statements. Thus, Accounting as an information\nsystem is necessitated by great complexity of modern business organisations.\nAccounting - An Introduction"

An\nauditor of the enterprise has to make a statement in his report whether, in his opinion,\nthe financial statements give a true and fair view. It means that the Balance Sheet should\ngive a true and fair view of the state of affairs and the Profit and Loss Account should\ngive the true and correct profit or loss for the period. Besides the above fundamental\ncharacteristics, there are other qualitative characteristics (attributes) that make the\ninformation content of the financial statements meaningful to its users. There are:\n1.   Reliability;\n2.   Relevance;\n3.   Understandability and\n4.   Comparability.\nLet us discuss these characteristics in detail:\n1.   Realiability : Accounting information must be reliable. the foremost factors that\nmake it reliable are that\ni.it  should  be  verifiable.  It  means,  transactions  should  be  evidenced  by\ndocuments. For example, purchases be evidenced by bills of purchases, sales\nbe evidenced by sales bills, etc.\nii.    it should be free from personal bias.

Users, therefore, cannot link interest cost to\ndifferent types of borrowed funds. In the process, they fail to appreciate the rationality\nof financing decisions. Generally, only the statutory (legal) required information is\ndisclosed. The information disclosure requirements are set after a public debate\nreflecting the views of cross-sections of users. But, what is relevant information in\na particular circumstance cannot be generalised and specified. The management of\nthe enterprise is in the best position to decide the contents of the information. It\nmay be noted that relevance of the information is always guided by the principle of\nmateriality.\n3.   Understandability : Understandability means that the information provided through\nthe financial statements be presented in a manner that the users are able to understand\nit in the manner it should be. However, if an information is considered relevant for\nthe users’ decision-making it must be disclosed even if the information is complex\nand not readily understandable by common users. The information disclosure\nrequirement of law must be fulfilled howsoever complex such information may be.\n4.   Comparability : Comparability means that the users should be able to compare\nthe accounting information of an enterprise of the period either with that of other\nperiods, known as intra-firm comparison or with the accounting information of\nother enterprises, known as inter-firm comparison. It is, therefore, necessary to\nfollow standardised accounting policies consistently to the extent possible.\nAccounting information to be useful should have all the above characteristics. The\naccounting information produced in the light of Reliability and Relevance Qualitative\nCharacteristics can be useful but its usefulness shall be limited if  it lacks understandability\nand comparability. We may explain this with the help of a diagram :\nReliability\nRelevance\ncan produce\nuseful accounting information\nwhich will be limited by\nlack of\nUnderstandability\nComparability\nAccounting - An Introduction"

In\nother words, we can state that\nIncome = Revenue - Expense\nGain\nUsually this term is used for profit of an irregular nature, for example, capital gain.\nLoss\nIt means something against which the firm receives no benefit. It is a fact that expenses\nlead to revenue but losses do not, such as theft.\nProfit\nIt is the excess of revenue of a business over its costs. It may be gross profit and net\nprofit. Gross profit is the difference between sales revenue or the proceeds of goods\nsold and/or services provided over its direct cost of the goods sold. Net profit is the\nprofit made after allowing for all types of expenses. There may be a net loss if the\nexpenses exceed the revenue.\nExpenditure\nSpending money or incurring a liability for some benefit, service or property received is\ncalled expenditure. Payment of rent, salary, purchase of goods, purchase of machinery,\netc. are some examples of expenditure. If the benefit of expenditure is exhausted within\na year, it is treated as revenue expenditure. In case the benefit of expenditure lasts for\nmore than one year, it is treated as an asset and also known as capital expenditure.\nExpenditure is usually the amount spent for the purchase of assets. It increases the\nprofit earning capacity of the business. Expense, on the other hand, is an amount to\nearn revenue. Expenditure is considered as capital expenditure unless it is qualified\nwith words like revenue expenditure on rent, salaries etc., while expense is always\nconsidered as a revenue expense because it is always incurred to earn revenue.\nDrawings\nIt is the amount of money or the value of goods which the proprietor takes away from\nbusiness for his/her household or private use.\nCapital\nIt is the amount invested in an enterprise by its owners e.g. paid up share capital in a\ncorporate enterprise. It also refers to the interest of owners in the assets of an enterprise.\nIt is the claim against the assets of the business. Any amount contributed by the owner\ntowards the business unit is a liability for the business enterprise. This liability is also\ntermed as capital which may be brought in the form of cash or assets by the owner.\nAccounting - An Introduction"

They raise the profit\nearning capacity of the business enterprise.\nAssets are broadly categorized as current assets and non-current assets/fixed assets.\nCurrent assets are those assets which are held for a short period generally one year’s\ntime. The balance of such items goes on fluctuating i.e. it keeps on changing throughout\nthe year. The balance of cash in hand may change so many times in a day. Various\ncurrent assets are cash in hand/at bank, debtors, bills receivable, stock, pre-paid\nexpenses.\nNon-current assets : Those assets are acquired for long term use in the business.\nSuch assets raise the profit earning capacity of the business enterprise. Expenditure on\nsuch assets is non-recurring and of capital nature. Expenses incurred on acquiring these\nassets are added to the value of the assets.\nLiability\nIt is the financial obligation of an enterprise other than owners’ funds.\nLiabilities : Liabilities mean the amount which the business owes to outsiders, that is,\nexcept the proprietors. In the words of Finny and Miller, “Liabilities are debts,\nthey are amounts owed to creditors.” Thus, the claims of those who are not owners\nare called Liabilities. This can be expressed as :\nLiabilities = Assets – Capital\nIn business, transactions are recorded taking business to be an entity distinct from its\nowners. Thus, capital invested by the proprietors is a liability but an internal liability. On\nthe other hand, external liability is a liability that is payable to outsiders, i.e., other\nthan the proprietors.\nExternal liability arises because of credit transactions or loans raised. Examples of\nexternal liabilities are creditors, bank overdraft, bills payable, outstanding liabilities.\nLiabilities can be classified into the following :\ni.Long-Term Liabilities : These are those liabilities which are payable after a long-\nterm, (generally more than a year).

Similarly, for a stationer,\nstationery is goods, whereas for others, it is an item of expense (not purchases). An\nenterprise may purchase assets for use in furtherance of business or stationery for use\nin the business, but they are not purchases of ‘goods’ but fixed asset and expense\nrespectively.\nReceivables : The term ‘Receivables’ includes the outstanding amount due from others.\nSometimes, a debtor may accept a Bill of Exchange, which is payable after a certain\nperiod. Such a bill is known as Bill Receivable. Sometimes, a debtor promises to\npay the specific amount in writing after a specified period. Such a promise is known as\na Promissory  Note  and  is  recorded  as  note  receivable.

In India there is a basic rule to be followed by everyone that\none should walk or drive on the left hand side of the road. It helps in the smooth flow\nof traffic. Similarly, there are certain rules that an accountant should follow while re-\ncording business transactions and preparing accounts. These may be termed as ac-\ncounting concepts. Thus, it can be said that :\nAccounting concepts refer to the basic assumptions, rules and principles which\nwork as the basis for recording of business transactions and preparing accounts.\n2\nACCOUNTING CONCEPTS\nOBJECTIVES"

All the concepts have been\ndeveloped over the years from experience and thus, they are universally accepted\nrules. Following are the various accounting concepts that have been discussed in the\nfollowing sections :\n Business entity concept\n Money measurement concept\n Going concern concept\n Accounting period concept\n Accounting cost concept\n Duality aspect concept\n Realisation concept\n Accrual concept\n Matching concept\n  2.2  BUSINESS  ENTITY  CONCEPT\nThis concept assumes that, for accounting purposes, the business enterprise and its\nowners are two separate independent entities. Thus, the business and personal\ntransactions of its owner are separate. For example, when the owner invests money in\nthe business, it is recorded as liability of the business to the owner. Similarly, when the\nowner takes away from the business cash/goods for his/her personal use, it is not\ntreated as business expense. Thus, the accounting records are made in the books of\naccounts from the point of view of the business unit and not the person owning the\nbusiness. This concept is the very basis of accounting.\nLet  us  take  an  example.  Suppose  Mr.  Sahoo  started  business  investing\n`100000. He purchased goods for `40000, Furniture for `20000 and plant and\nmachinery of `30000. `10000 remains in hand. These are the assets of the business\nand not of the owner. According to the business entity concept `100000 will be treated\nby business as capital i.e. a liability of business towards the owner of the business.\nNow suppose, he takes away `5000 cash or goods worth `5000 for his domestic\npurposes. This withdrawal of cash/goods by the owner from the business is his private\nexpense and not an expense of the business. It is termed as Drawings. Thus, the business\nentity concept states that business and the owner are two separate/distinct persons.\nAccordingly, any expense incurred by owner for himself or his family from business will\nbe considered as expenses and it will be shown as drawings.\nAccounting Concepts"

In our country such transactions are in terms of rupees.\nThus, as per the money measurement concept, transactions which can be expressed in\nterms of money are recorded in the books of accounts. For example, sale of goods\nworth `200000, purchase of raw materials `100000, Rent Paid `10000 etc. are\nexpressed in terms of money, and so these are recorded in the books of accounts. But\nthe transactions which cannot be expressed in monetary terms are not recorded in the\nbooks of accounts. For example, sincerity, loyality, honesty of employees are not\nrecorded in books of accounts because these cannot be measured in terms of money\nalthough they do affect the profits and losses of the business concern.\nAnother aspect of this concept is that the records of the transactions are to be kept not\nin the physical units but in the monetary unit.

It means that fixed assets like building, plant and machinery,\nfurniture, etc are recorded in the books of accounts at a price paid for them. For\nexample, a machine was purchased by XYZ Limited for `500000, for manufacturing\nshoes. An amount of `1,000 were spent on transporting the machine to the factory site.\nIn addition, `2000 were spent on its installation. The total amount at which the machine\nwill be recorded in the books of accounts would be the sum of all these items i.e.\n`503000. This cost is also known as historical cost. Suppose the market price of the\nsame is now ` 90000 it will not be shown at this value. Further, it may be clarified that\ncost means original or acquisition cost only for new assets and for the used ones, cost\nmeans original cost less depreciation. The cost concept is also known as historical cost\nconcept. The effect of cost concept is that if the business entity does not pay anything\nfor acquiring an asset this item would not appear in the books of accounts. Thus,\ngoodwill appears in the accounts only if the entity has purchased this intangible asset\nfor a price.\nSignificance\n This concept requires asset to be shown at the price at which it has been acquired,\nwhich can be verified from the supporting documents.\n It helps in calculating depreciation on fixed assets.\n The effect of cost concept is that if the business entity does not pay anything for an\nasset, this item will not be shown in the books of accounts.\nFill in the blanks with suitable word/words\ni.The cost concept states that all fixed assets are recorded in the books of accounts\nat their ___________ price.\nii.

The cost concept is otherwise known as ............. concept.\n  2.7  DUAL  ASPECT  CONCEPT\nDual aspect is the foundation or basic principle of accounting. It provides the very\nbasis of recording business transactions in the books of accounts. This concept as-\nsumes that every transaction has a dual effect, i.e. it affects two accounts in their re-\nspective opposite sides. Therefore, the transaction should be recorded at two places.\nIt means, both the aspects of the transaction must be recorded in the books of ac-\ncounts. For example, goods purchased for cash has two aspects which are (i) Giving\nof cash (ii) Receiving of goods. These two aspects are to be recorded.\nThus, the duality concept is commonly expressed in terms of fundamental accounting\nequation :\nAssets = Liabilities + Capital\nThe above accounting equation states that the assets of a business are always equal to\nthe claims of owner/owners and the outsiders. This claim is also termed as capital or\nowners equity and that of outsiders, as liabilities or creditors’ equity.\nThe knowledge of dual aspect helps in identifying the two aspects of a transaction\nwhich helps in applying the rules of recording the transactions in books of accounts.\nThe implication of dual aspect concept is that every transaction has an equal impact on\nassets  and liabilities in such a way that total assets are always equal to total liabilities.\nLet us analyse some more business transactions in terms of their dual aspect :\n1.   Capital brought in by the owner of the business\nThe two aspects in this transaction are :\n(i)   Receipt of cash\n(ii)Increase in Capital (owners equity)\n2.   Purchase of machinery by cheque\nThe two aspects in the transaction are\n(i)   Reduction  in Bank Balance\n(ii)Owning of Machinery\nAccounting Concepts"

The term realisation means creation of\nlegal right to receive money. Selling goods is realisation, receiving order is not.\nIn other words, it can be said that :\nRevenue is said to have been realised when cash has been received or right to\nreceive cash on the sale of goods or services or both have been created.\nLet us study the following examples :\ni.    N.P.  Jeweller  received  an  order  to  supply  gold  ornaments  worth\n`5,00,000. They supplied ornaments worth `2,00,000 up to the year ending 31\nst\nDecember 2013 and rest of the ornaments were supplied in January 2014.\nii.    Bansal sold goods for `1,00,000 for cash in 2013 and the goods have been deliv-\nered during the same year.\niii.Akshay sold goods on credit for `50,000 during the year ending 31\nst\n December\n2013. The goods have been delivered in 2013 but the payment was received in\nMarch 2014.\nNow, let us analyse the above examples to ascertain the correct amount of revenue\nrealised for the year ending 31\nst\n December 2013.\ni.The revenue for the year 2013 for N.P. Jeweller is `200000. Mere getting an\norder is not considered as revenue until the goods have been delivered.\nii.    The revenue for Bansal for year 2013 is `1,00,000 as the goods have been deliv-\nered in the year 2013. Cash has also been received in the same year.\niii.Akshay’s revenue for the year 2013 is `50,000, because the goods have been\ndelivered to the customer in the year 2013. Revenue became due in the year 2013\nitself. In the above examples, revenue is realised when the goods are delivered to\nthe customers.\nThe concept of realisation states that revenue is realized at the time when goods\nor services are actually delivered.\nIn short, the realisation occurs when the goods and services have been sold either for\ncash or on credit. It also refers to inflow of assets in the form of receivables.\nSignificance\n It helps in making the accounting information more objective.\n It provides that the transactions should be recorded only when goods  are deliv-\nered to the buyer.\nAccounting Concepts"

It means that\nrevenues are recognised when they become receivable. Though cash is received or not\nreceived and the expenses are recognised when they become payable though cash is\npaid or not paid. Both transactions will be recorded in the accounting period to which\nthey relate. Therefore, the accrual concept makes a distinction between the accrual\nreceipt of cash and the right to receive cash as regards revenue and actual payment of\ncash and obligation to pay cash as regards expenses.\nThe accrual concept under accounting assumes that revenue is realised at the time of\nsale of goods or services irrespective of the fact when the cash is received. For ex-\nample, a firm sells goods for `55000 on 25th March 2014 and the payment is not\nreceived until 10th April 2014, the amount is due and payable to the firm on the date of\nsale i.e. 25th March 2014. It must be included in the revenue for the year ending 31st\nMarch 2014. Similarly, expenses are recognised at the time services provided, irre-\nspective of the fact when actual payment for these services are made. For example, if\nthe firm received goods costing `20000 on 29th March 2014 but the payment is made\non 2nd April 2014 the accrual concept requires that expenses must be recorded for the\nyear ending 31st March 2014 although no payment has been made until 31st March\n2014 though the service has been received and the person to whom the payment\nshould have been made is shown as creditor.\nINTEXT  QUESTIONS  2.7\nAccounting Concepts"

So once the revenue is realised,\nthe next step is to allocate it to the relevant accounting period. This can be done with\nthe help of accrual concept.\nLet us study the following transactions of a business during the month of December,\n2006\n(i)  Sale : cash `2000 and credit `1000\n(ii)Salaries Paid `350\n(iii)Commission Paid `150\n(iv)Interest Received `50\n(v)  Rent received `140, out of which `40 received for the year 2007\n(vi)Carriage paid `20\n(vii)Postage `30\n(viii)Rent paid `200, out of which `50 belong to the year 2005\n(ix)Goods purchased in the year for cash `1500 and on credit `500\n(x)  Depreciation on machine `200\nINTEXT  QUESTIONS  2.8\nAccounting Concepts"

These concepts or assumptions or principles are working rules for all\naccounting activities.\nYou may visit some business units doing a particular kind of business. Enquire them and\nfind out how unsold goods are being valued. You will find that they follow the same\nmethod of valuation of unsold stock of goods. If you ask them, why do they value the\nunsold goods at cost or market price, whichever is lower, even though the market price\nis higher than the cost price, the businessman may answer that it is the convention,\ntradition or practice or custom of the business, that business is following year after\nyear. In accounting, there are many conventions or practices which are used while\nrecording the transactions in the books of accounts. Apart from these, the Institute of\nChartered Accountants of India (ICAI), which is the main regulatory body for\nstandardisation of accounting policies in the country has issued a number of accounting\nstandards from time to time to bring consistency in the accounting practices. We shall\nstudy about accounting conventions and standards in detail in this lesson.\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to :\n explain the meaning of accounting convention;\n explain the meaning and significance of accounting consventions like consistency,\nfull disclosure, materiality and conservatism;\n state the meaning of the term Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP);\nOBJECTIVES"

They are\nfollowed like customs, traditions, etc. in a society. Accounting conventions are evolved\nthrough the regular and consistent practice over the years to facilitate uniform recording\nin the books of accounts. Accounting Conventions help in comparing accounting data\nof different business units or of the same unit for different periods. These have been\ndeveloped over the years. The most important conventions which have been used for\na long period are :\n Convention of consistency.\n Convention of full disclosure.\n Convention of materiality.\n Convention of conservatism.\n  3.2  CONVENTION  OF  CONSISTENCY\nThe convention of consistency means that same accounting principles should be used\nfor preparing financial statements year after year. A meaningful conclusion can be drawn\nfrom financial statements of the same enterprise when there is a comparison between\nthem over a period of time. But this can be possible only when accounting policies and\npractices followed by the enterprise are uniform and consistent over a period of time.\nIf different accounting procedures and practices are used for preparing financial\nstatements of different years, then the result will not be comparable.\nGenerally a businessman follows the undermentioned general practices or methods\nyear after year.\nWhile charging depreciation on fixed assets or valuing unsold stock, once a particular\nmethod is used it should be followed year after year so that the financial statements can\nbe analysed and compared provided that the depreciation on fixed assets is charged or\nunsold stock is valued by using particular method year after year. This can be further\nclarified as : in case of charging depreciation on fixed assets accountant can decide to\nadopt any one of the methods of depreciation such as diminishing value method or\nstraight line method.\nSimilarly, in case of valuation of closing stock it can be valued at actual cost price or\nmarket price or whichever is less. However precious metals like gold, diamond, minerals\nare generally valued at market price only.\nAccounting Conventions & Standards"

      "content": "42\nNotes\nMODULE  -  1\nBasic Accounting\nACCOUNTANCY\nTypes  of  consistency\nThere are three types of consistency namely :\ni.Vertical consistency (Same organisation) : It is to be found within the group of\ninter-related financial statements of an organisation on the same date. It occurs\nwhen fixed assets have been shown at cost price and in the interrelated income\nstatement depreciation has also been charged on the historical cost of the assets.\nii.   Horizontal consistency (Time basis) : This consistency is to be found between\nfinancial statements of one entity from period to period. Thus, it helps in comparing\nperformance of the business between two years i.e. current year with past year.\niii.Dimensional  consistency  (Two  organisations  in  the  same  trade)  :  This\nconsistency is to be found in the statements of two different business entities of the\nsame period. This type of consistency assists in making comparison of the\nperformance of one business entity with the other business entity in the same trade\nand on the same date.\nTherefore, as per this convention the same accounting methods should be adopted\nevery year in preparing financial statements. But it does not mean that a particular\nmethod of accounting once adopted can never be changed. Whenever a change in\nmethod is necessary, it should be disclosed by way of footnotes in the financial statements\nof that year.\nSignificance\n It facilitates comparative analysis of the financial statements.\n It ensures uniformity in charging depreciation on fixed assets and valuation of closing\nstock.\nFill in the blanks with suitable word/words\ni.Convention of consistency means that same accounting principles should be used\nfor preparing financial statements ............\nii.

Full disclosure means that there should\nbe full, fair and adequate disclosure of accounting information. Adequate means sufficient\nset of information to be disclosed. Fair indicates an equitable treatment of users. Full\nrefers to complete and detailed presentation of information. Thus, the convention of full\ndisclosure suggests that every financial statement should fully disclose all relevant\ninformation. Let us relate it to the business. The business provides financial information\nto all interested parties like investors, lenders, creditors, shareholders etc. The\nshareholders would like to know profitability of the firm while the creditors would like\nto know the solvency of the business. In the same way, other parties would be interested\nin the financial information according to their requirements. This is possible if financial\nstatements disclose all relevant information in full, fair and adequate manner.\nLet us take an example. As per accounts, net sales are `1,50,000, it is important for\nthe interested parties to know the amount of gross sales which may be `2,00,000 and\nthe sales return `50,000. The disclosure of 25% sales returns may help them to find\nout the actual sales position. Therefore, whatever details are available, that must be\nhonestly provided. Additional information should also be given in the financial statements.\nFor example, in a balance sheet the basis of valuation of assets, such as investments,\ninventories, land and building etc. should be clearly stated. Similarly, any change in the\nmethod of depreciation or in making provision for bad debts or creating any reserve\nmust also be shown clearly in the Balance Sheet. Therefore, in order to achieve the\npurpose of accounting, all the transactions of a business and any change in accounting\npolicies, methods and procedures are fully recorded and presented in accounting.\nTo ensure proper disclosure of material accounting information, the Companies Act\n1956, under schedule VI has provided a format for the preparation of Profit and Loss\naccount and Balance Sheet of a company. It is necessary for every company to follow\nthis format. The regulatory bodies like Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)\nhas also made compulsory for complete disclosures by registered companies.\nSignificance\n It helps in meaningful comparison of financial statements of the different business\nunits.\n This can also help in the comparison of financial statements of different years of the\nsame business unit.\n This convention is of great help to investor and shareholder for making investment\ndecisions.\n The convention of full disclosure presents reliable information.\nAccounting Conventions & Standards"

All relevant material facts should be ___________ in the financial statements.\nv.    The full disclosure convention presents ___________ information.\n  3.4  CONVENTION  OF  MATERIALITY\nThe convention of materiality states that, to make financial statements meaningful, only\nmaterial facts i.e. important and relevant information should be supplied to the users of\naccounting information. The question that arises here is what is a material fact. The\nmateriality of a fact depends on its nature and the amount involved. Material fact means\nthe information of which will influence the decision of its user.\nFor example, a businessman is dealing in electronic goods. He purchases T.V.,\nRefrigerator, Washing Machine, Computer etc. for his business. In buying these\nitems he uses larger part of his capital. These items are significant items; thus,\nthese should be recorded in the books of accounts in detail. At the same time to\nmaintain day to day office work he purchases pen, pencil, match box, scented\nstick, etc. For this he will use very small amount of his capital. But to maintain\nthe details of every pen, pencil, match box or other small items is not considered\nof much significance. These items are insignificant items and hence they should\nbe recorded separately. Thus, the items that are significantly important in recording\nthe details are termed as material facts or significant items. The items that are of\nless significance are immaterial facts or insignificant items.\nThus  according  to  this  convention,  important  and  significant  items  should  be\nrecorded in their respective heads and all immaterial or insignificant transactions\nshould be clubbed under a different accounting head.\nSignificance\n \nIt helps in minimising the errors of calculation.\n It helps in making financial statements more meaningful.\n It saves time and resources.\nINTEXT  QUESTIONS  3.2\nAccounting Conventions & Standards"

It provides guidance for recording transactions in the books of\naccounts. It is based on the policy of playing safe in regard to showing profit. The main\nobjective of this convention is to show minimum profit. Profit should not be overstated.\nIf profit shows more than actual, it may lead to distribution of dividend out of capital.\nThis is not a fair policy and it will lead to the reduction in the capital of the enterprise.\nThus, this convention clearly states that profit should not be recorded until it is realised.\nBut if the business anticipates any loss in the near future, provision should be made in\nthe books of accounts for the same. For example, valuing closing stock at cost or\nmarket price whichever is lower, creating provision for doubtful debts, discount on\ndebtors, writing off intangible assets like goodwill, patent, etc. The convention of\nconservatism is a very useful tool in situation of uncertainty and doubts.\nSignificance\n \nIt helps in ascertaining actual profit.\n It is useful in the situation of uncertainties and doubts.\n It helps in maintaining the capital of the enterprise.\nGive your decision in the following situations :\ni.A  business  has  unsold  stock  at  the  end  of  year.

These rules/principles are called by different names such\nas principles, concepts, conventions, postulates, assumptions. These rules/principles\nare judged on their general acceptability rather than universal acceptability. Hence,\nthey are popularly called Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The term\n“generally accepted” means that these principles must have support, that generally\ncomes from the professional accounting bodies. Thus, Generally Accepted Accounting\nPrinciples (GAAP) refer to the rules or guidelines adopted for recording and reporting\nof business transactions of financial statements. These principles have evolved over a\nlong period of time on the basis of past experiences, usages or customs, etc. These\nprinciples are also referred as concepts and conventions, which have already been\ndiscussed.\nAccounting standards : Concept and Objectives\nThe term standard denotes a discipline, which provides both guidelines and yardsticks\nfor evaluation. As guidelines, accounting standards provide uniform practices and\ncommon techniques of accounting. As a general rule, accounting standards are\napplicable to all corporate enterprises. They are made operative from a date specified\nin the standards. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) constituted\nthe Accounting Standards Board (ASB) in April, 1977 for developing accounting\nstandards. However, the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) was\nset up in 1973, with its headquarter in London (U.K.).\nThe Accounting Standards Board is entrusted with the responsibility of formulating\nstandards  on  significant  accounting  matters  keeping  in  view  the  international\ndevelopments, and legal requirements in India.\nThe main function of the ASB is to identify areas in which uniformity in standards is\nrequired and to develop draft standards after discussions with representatives of the\nGovernment, public sector undertakings, industries and other agencies.\nAccounting Conventions & Standards"

Whatever business possesses in the form\nof assets is financed by proprietor or by outsiders. This equation expresses the equality\nof assets on the one side and equity on the other side i.e., the claims of outsider [liabili-\nties] and owners or proprietors funds on the other side. In mathematical form,\nAssets = Equity\nEquity = Liabilities + Capital\nAs an asset is introduced in the business, a corresponding liability also emerges.\nEffect of business transactions on accounting equation\nThese transactions increase or decrease the assets, liabilities, or capital. Every business\nhas some assets. For example, Sunil started business with cash `3,00,000 as Capital.\nIn this transaction, asset in the form of cash is created for the business. Hence,\nCash (Asset)Capital (Equity)\n`3,00,000=`3,00,000\nSunil purchased Machinery for `40,000 and Furniture for `20,000.

In other words, every business concern owes money from outsiders. Money\nborrowed from outsiders is called as liability. For example, `1,50,000 were borrowed\nfrom Shipra. Thus, the position of the assets and capital will be as under\nCash+Machinery   +Furniture=Liabilities+Capital\n2,35,000   +40,000+20,000=02,95,000\n+1,50,000  +0+0=1,50,000+0\n3,85.000   +40,000+20,000=1,50,000+2,95.000\nThe fact that business receives funds from proprietors and creditors and retains all of\nthem in the form of assets, can be presented in the terms of an accounting equation as\nunder\nAssets=Liabilities+CapitalorA= L+ C\nOR\nLiabilities=Assets–CapitalorL= A – C\nOR\nCapital=Assets–LiabilitiesorC = A – L\nAccounting for Business Transactions"

Their effect is always on\nthe capital.\nA business concern has to meet some expenses in its normal course of operations such\nas payment of salary, rent, insurance premium, postage, wages, repairs etc. Payment\nof these expenses reduces the cash. These expenses reduce the net income of the\nbusiness. All the income is the income of proprietor, which is added in the capital\naccount, so all these expenses are deducted from the capital. Similarly, business con-\ncern receives some revenues during normal course of operations, such as rent re-\nceived, commission received, etc. Revenue is added to the cash balance as it is re-\nceived in terms of cash. Revenue increases the net income of the business and hence, it\nis added to the capital. Now, the accounting equation is represented by\nAssets=Liabilities+Capital\n+ Revenue [Cash]=+Revenue\n– Expenses [Cash]=–Expenses\nAccounting equation is thus, affected by every business transaction. Any increase or\ndecrease in assets, liabilities, and capital can be identified by preparing accounting\nequation. It shows that every business transaction satisfies the dual aspect concept of\naccounting. It also serves as the basis for preparing the Balance Sheet.\nEffect of Transactions on the Accounting Equation\nYou have learnt that assets, liabilities and capital are the three basic elements of every\nbusiness transaction, and their relationship is expressed in the form of accounting equa-\ntion which always remains equal. At any point of time, there can be a change in the\nindividual asset, liability or capital, but the two sides of the accounting equation always\nremain equal. Let us verify this fact by taking up some transactions and see how these\ntransactions affect the accounting equation :\n1.   Namita started business with cash `3,50,000 introduced as capital. Thus the equation\nis as:\nAssets=Liabilities+Capital\n3,50,000=0+3,50,000\nThis transaction shows that `3,50,000 have been introduced by Namita in terms\nof cash, which is the capital for the business concern. Hence on one hand, the asset\n[cash] has been created to the extent of `3,50,000.\nAccounting for Business Transactions"

Cash Basis of accounting\nThis is a system in which accounting entries are recorded only when cash is received or\npaid. Revenue is recognized only on receipt of cash. Similarly, expenses are recorded\nas incurred when they are paid. The difference between the total revenues and total\nexpenses represents profit or loss of an enterprise for a particular accounting period.\nOutstanding and prepaid expenses and income received in advance or accrued in-\ncomes are not considered.\nAdvantages\nFollowing are the advantages of adopting cash basis of accounting:\n It is very simple as no adjustment entries are required.\n It appears more objective as very few estimates and personal judgments are re-\nquired.\n It is more suitable to those entities which have most of the transactions on cash\nbasis.\nDisadvantages\nFollowing are the disadvantages of adopting cash basis of accounting:\n It does not give a true and fair view of profit and loss and the financial position of\nthe business unit as it ignores outstanding and prepaid expenses.\n It does not follow the matching concept of accounting.\nIllustration 7\nDuring the financial year 2013-14, Mela Ram had cash sales of `580000 and credit\nsales of `265000. His expenses for the year were `.460000 out of which `60000 are\nstill to be paid.

Accrual Basis of accounting\nRevenue and expense are taken into consideration for the purpose of income determi-\nnation on the basis of accounting period to which they relate. The accrual basis makes\na distinction between actual receipts of cash and the right to receive cash for revenues\nand the actual payment of cash and the legal obligation to pay expenses. It means the\nincome accrued in the current year becomes the income of the current year whether the\ncash for that item is received in the current year or it was received in the previous year\nor it will be received in the next year. The same is true of expense items. Expense item\nis recorded if it becomes payable in the current year whether it is paid in the current\nyear or it was paid in the previous year or it will be paid in the next year. For example,\ncredit sales are included in the total sales of the period irrespective of the fact when\ncash on account is received. Similarly, in case the firm has taken benefit of a certain\nservice, but has not paid within that period, the expense will relate to the period in\nwhich the service has been utilized and not the period in which the payment for it is\nmade.\nOutstanding Expenses are those expenses which have become due during the ac-\ncounting period but which have yet not been paid off. Prepaid Expenses are those\nexpenses which have been paid in advance. Accrued Income means income which has\nbeen earned by the business during the accounting period but has not yet become due\nfor payment and therefore has not yet been received. Income received in advance\nmeans income which has been received by the business before being earned. Costs\nincurred during a particular period should be set out against the revenue of the period\nto ascertain profit or loss.\nFollowing are the advantages :\n It is based on all business transactions of the year and discloses correct profit or\nloss.\n This method is used in all types of of business units.\n It is more scientific and rational in application.\nAccounting for Business Transactions"

The Double entry Book-Keeping seeks to record every trans-\naction in money or money’s worth in its dual aspect. The advantages of  double\nentry mechanism are :\n Systematic Record: It records, classifies, and synthesizes the business trans-\naction in a systematic manner. It provides reliable information for sound de-\ncision making. It meets the needs of users of accounting information.\n Complete Record: It maintains complete record of a business transaction. It\nrecords both the aspects of the transaction with narration.\n Accurate records: By Preparing a Summarised Statement of Account the ar-\nithmetical accuracy of the records can be checked.\nAccounting for Business Transactions"

But if an entry contains\nmore than one debit or credit or both, that entry is known as a compound journal entry.\nActually, a compound journal entry is a combination of two or more simple journal\nentries.\nThus, a compound journal entry can be made in the following three ways:\n(i)By debiting one account and crediting more than one account.\n(ii)    By debiting more than one account and crediting one account.\n(iii)   By debiting more than one account and also crediting more than one account.\nTwo simple journal entries are as :\nJournal\nDr.Cr.\nDateParticularsL.F.Amount    Amount\n``\n``\n`\n``\n``\n`\n2014\nNov. 30Salary A/cDr.6,000\nTo Cash A/c6,000\n(Salary paid in Cash)\nNov. 30Rent A/cDr.12,000\nTo Cash A/c12,000\n(Rent paid in Cash)\nThe above two simple entries have been converted into compound Journal entry as\nunder :\n2014\nNov. 30Salary A/cDr.6,000\nRent A/cDr.12,000\nTo Cash A/c18,000\n(Payment of Salary and Rent in Cash)\nNote :To make the compound entry, it is necessary that the transactions must be of\nthe same date and one account is common.\nJournal"

Bad  Debts\nWhen a debtor fails to pay the full amount due to him, the unpaid amount is known as\nbad debts.\nFor example, A business concern receives ` 8000 out of ` 10,000 due from Harish.\nHe is unable to pay the balance amount, thus, the remaining amount becomes a bad\ndebts for the business.\nThe compound entry for this transaction will be :\nBank A/cDr.8,000\nBad Debts A/cDr.2,000\nTo Harish’s A/c10,000\n(Receipt of ` 8,000 from Harish and remaining due\namount of  ` 2,000 is treated as bad debts)\n2.

Thus,\nthere can be two situations : (a) Amount has been received or paid which belongs to\nmore than one accounting year (b) amount of expense or of revenue for the current\nyear stands due and not paid. In the above two cases adjustments need to be made.\nAny journal entry made to adjust these amounts is called adjusting journal entry.\nJournal entries made to adjust for outstanding expenses such as rent outstanding, prepaid\nexpenses such as insurance premium paid in advance, accrued income such as rent\n(income) has become due but not received and  income received in advance such as\ncommission has been received though not yet due are examples of adjusting journal\nentries.\nFollowing are the items for which adjustment is required :\nJournal"

Outstanding Expenses\nAn expense for the current accounting peirod should be debited (as increase in expense\nis to be debited). It is immaterial whether it is paid in that accounting period or not. In\ncase the same expense is not paid during the year, it becomes outstanding for that\nparticular year. It is the liability of the business for that year and, thus, expense outstanding\naccount will be credited, because liabilities are credited for increase.\nFor example, if salaries are outstanding for ` 5,000 for December 2014 then the entry\nwill be made as follows:\n2014Salaries A/cDr.5,000\nDec.31To Salaries outstanding A/c5,000\n(Salaries remaining unpaid for the month of December)\n2. Prepaid Expenses\nThis is an expense relating to the next year that has been paid in advance during the\ncurrent year. Thus, in such a case, this amount should not be treated as an expense for\nthis year. It should be treated as an asset in the current year as the services will be\nreceived only in the next year (but the payment has been made in this year). As an\nincrease in asset is debited, so prepaid expense account will also be debited.\nIf, for example, Insurance is prepaid for 2015 in 2014 for ` 3,000 then entry will be\nmade as follows:\n2014Prepaid Insurance A/cDr.3,000\nDec. 14To Insurance Premium A/c3,000\n(Insurance paid in advance)\n3. Accrued Income\nIn case, income has been earned but it has not been recieved till now, it is an accrued\nincome. Accrued Income is an asset, as there will be an increase in the asset, it will be\ndebited.\nFor example, Rent (receivable) is outstanding for the month of November `4,000. The\nentry in such a case will be:\nAccrued Rent A/cDr.4,000\nTo Rent A/c4,000\n(Being Rent due but not yet received for the period)\nNote :Here Rent Income A/c has been credited for the increase to be made in the\namount of Rent for the period of November, which has to be included in the total Rent\nIncome.\nJournal"

Income  Received  in  Advance\nWhenever Income is received in advance during the current year i.e. it is received for\nthe next year, it should not be included in the current year’s income. As this income\npertains to the next year, it cannot be treated as income in the current year, so it becomes\na liability. As there is an increase in the liability, it should be credited.\nFor example, if Rent is received in advance for the period January and February 2015\nin December 2014, ` 9,000. Then the entry will be\nRent A/cDr.9,000\nTo Rent Received in Advance A/c9,000\n(Rent received in advance for January and\nFebruary 2015 in the month of December 2014)\nNote :Here Rent Income A/c has been debited as it has to be decreased by ` 9,000\nbeing Rent in advance for January and February 2015 which should not be included in\nthe month of December 2014 as the services have not yet been rendered.\nMiscellaneous Entries\n(a)  Depreciation\nDepreciation means decline in the value of an asset due to its wear and tear. It is an\nexpense for the business. Increase in expenses and losses are debited, so depreciation\nis also to be debited. The value of the asset will also be reduced because of depreciation.\nAs decrease in assets is credited, so the same asset account will be credited.\nFor example, Depreciation on furniture ` 3,000 is charged for the year, Journal entry\nwill be :\nDepreciation A/cDr.3,000\nTo Furniture A/c3,000\n(Depreciation charged on furniture)\n(b)  Interest  on  Capital\nBusiness may allow interest to its proprietor on his/her capital. It is an expense for the\nbusiness. As the expense is debited for the increase, interest on capital will be debited.\nThe other account involved here is capital account. As Capital is increasing, it will be\ncredited with the amount of interest on capital.\nJournal"

It is also\nknown as Returns Outward Journal/Book.\nv.   Sale Returns or Returns Inward Journal : Sometimes, when the goods are\nsold to the customer and they are not satisfied with the goods, they may return\nthese goods to the businessman. Such returns are known as Sales Returns. Just\nlike Purchase Returns, they are also recorded in a separate Book which is known\nas Sales Returns or Returns Inward Journal/Book.\nNote : You will learn more details about these Special journals in the subsequent\nlessons.\nvi.  Bill Receivables Journal/Book : When goods are sold on credit and the date\nand period of payment is agreed upon between the seller and the buyer, this is\nduly signed by both the parties. This written document is called a Bill of exchange.\nFor the seller it is a bill receivable and for the buyer it is a bill payable. Bills\nReceivable Journal/Book and Bills Payable Journal Book are two journals\nprepared by a businessman. For example : Pranaya sells goods to Gunakshi on\ncredit for `5,000 payable after three months. A document is prepared containing\nthese facts and is duly signed by Pranaya and Gunakshi. For Pranaya, it is a Bills\nReceivable and she will record this transaction in Bill Receivable Book.

Journal Proper\nThis journal is meant for recording all such transactions for which no special journal has\nbeen maintained in the business. Therefore, in this journal, all such transactions are\nrecorded which do not occur frequently and for these transactions, no special journal is\nrequired. For example, if Machinery is purchased on credit, it will be recorded in the\njournal proper, because in the Cash Book, we will record only cash purchases of\nmachinery.

The accounting process does not stop here. The transactions\nare recorded in number of books in chronological order. Such recording of business\ntransactions serves little purpose of accounting. Items of same title in different books of\naccounts need to be brought at one place under one head called an account. There are\nnumerous account titles of items/persons or accounts. All the accounts, if brought in\none account book, will be more informative and useful. The account book so maintained\nis called Ledger.\nIn this lesson, you will learn about Ledger and posting of items entered in various\nbooks of accounts to ledger.\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to:\nzstate the meaning, features and importance of ledger;\nzenumerate the various types of ledger;\nzstate the meaning of posting and explain the steps of posting journal into ledger;\nzcalculate the balance of the account in the ledger.\n  6.1  LEDGER  :  MEANING,  IMPORTANCE  AND  TYPES\nYou have already learnt about accounts. Each transaction affects two accounts. In\neach account transactions related to that account are recorded. For example, sale of\ngoods taking place number of times in a year will be put under one Account i.e. Sales\nAccount.\nOBJECTIVES"

So a ledger is a book of account; in\nwhich all types of accounts relating to assets, liabilities, capital, expenses and revenues\nare maintained. It is a complete set of accounts of a business enterprise.\nLedger is bound book with pages consecutively numbered. It may also be a\nbundle of sheets.\nThus, from the various journals/Books of a business enterprise, all transactions recorded\nthroughout the accounting year are placed in relevant accounts in the ledger through the\nprocess of posting of transactions in the ledger. Thus, posting is the process of transfer\nof entries from Journal/Special Journal Books to ledger.\nFeatures of Ledger\nzLedger is an account book that contains various accounts to which various business\ntransactions of a business enterprise are posted.\nzIt is a book of final entry because the transactions that are first entered in the\njournal or special purpose Books are finally posted in the ledger. It is also\ncalled the Principal Book of Accounts.\nzIn the ledger all types of accounts relating to assets, liabilities, capital, revenue\nand expenses are maintained.\nzIt  is  a  permanent  record  of  business  transactions  classified  into  relevant\naccounts.\nzIt  is  the  ‘reference  book  of  accounting  system  and  is  used  to  classify  and\nsummarise transactions to facilitate the preparation of financial statements.\nFormat  of  a  Ledger  Sheet\nThe format of a ledger sheet is as follows :\nTitle of An Account\nDr.Cr.\nDate    ParticularsJFAmountDateParticularsJFAmount\n``\n``\n`\n``\n``\n`\nLedger"

It depends upon\nthe number of items related to that account to be posted.\nImportance of Ledger/Utility of Ledger\nLedger is an important book of Account. It contains all the accounts in which all the\ntransactions of a business enterprise are classified. At the end of the accounting period,\neach account will contain the entire information of all the transactions relating to it.\nFollowing are the advantages of ledger.\nzKnowledge of Business Results : Ledger provides detailed information about\nrevenues and expenses at one place. While finding out business results the revenue\nand expenses are matched with each other.\nzKnowledge of Book Value of Assets : Ledger records every asset separately.\nHence, you can get the information about the Book value of any asset whenever\nyou need.\nzUseful for Management : The information given in different ledger accounts will\nhelp the management in preparing budgets. It also helps the management in keeping\nthe check on the performance of business it is managing.\nzKnowledge of Financial Position : Ledger provides information about assets\nand liabilities of the business. From this we can judge the financial position and\nhealth of the business.\nzInstant Information : The business always need to know what it owes to others\nand what the others owe to it. The ledger accounts provide this information at a\nglance through the account receivables and payables.\nTypes  of  Ledger\nIn large scale business organisations, the number of accounts may run into hundreds. It\nis not always possible for a businessman to accommodate all these accounts in one\nledger. They, therefore, maintain more than one ledger.\nThese ledgers may be as follows :\n1.   Assets Ledger : It contains accounts relating to assets only e.g. Machinery account,\nBuilding account, Furniture account, etc.\n2.   Liabilities Ledger : It contains the accounts of various liabilities e.g. Capital (Owner\nor partner), Loan account, Bank overdraft, etc.\n3.

If debit side total is more than the credit side,\nthe account shows a debit balance. Similarly, the balance will be credit balance if the\ncredit side total of an account is more than the debit side total. This process of ascertaining\nand writing the balance of each account in the ledger is called balancing of an account.\nAn account has two sides : debit and credit. Items by which this account is debited are\nentered on its debit side with their amounts and items by which this account is credited\nare entered on its credit side with their amounts so all items related to an account are\nshown at one place in the ledger. But then you would like to know the net effect of this\naccount i.e. the balance between its debit amount and credit amount. The following\nsteps are  followed in Balancing the Ledger Account :\nzTotal the two sides of an Account on a rough sheet.\nzDetermine the difference between the two sides. If the credit side is more than the\ndebit side, the balance calculated is a credit balance.\nzPut the difference on the ‘Shorter side’ of the account such that the totals of the\ntwo sides of the account are equal.\nzIf the difference amount is written on debit side (i.e., if credit. side is bigger) then\nwrite as “Balance c/d” (c/d stands for carried down). If difference is written on the\ncredit side (i.e., if debit side is bigger) then write it as “Balance c/d.\nzFinally at the end of the year all the ledger accounts are closed by taking out the\nbalance of each account.\nzThe Balance then should be brought down or carried forward to the next period. If\nthe difference was put on credit side as “Balance c/d” it should now be written on\nthe debit side of the account as “Balance b/d” (b/d stands for brought down) and\nvice-a-versa. Thus, debit balance will automatically be brought down on the debit\nside and a credit balance on the credit side.\nBalancing of Different Types of Accounts\nAssets:All asset accounts are balanced. These accounts always have\na debit balance.\nLiabilities:All Liability accounts are balanced. All these accounts have a\ncredit balance.\nCapital:This account is always balanced and usually has a credit\nbalance.\nLedger"

At the time of preparing the Trial Balance,\nthe totals of these are taken to the Trial Balance.\nThe Balance of Assets, Liabilities and Capital Accounts will be shown in Balance Sheet\nwhereas total of Expense/Loss and Revenue/Income will be taken to the Trading and\nProfit and Loss Account. These Accounts are, thus, closed.\nIf two sides of an Account (usually Assets, Liabilities and Capital) are equal there will\nbe no balance.

This implies that Cash Book is a book where\nall the receipts in terms of cash are recorded on the debit side of the Cash Book\nand all the payments in terms of cash are recorded on its credit side. This means:\nCash Book records all transactions related to receipts and payments in terms\nof Cash only.\nOn the debit side in the particulars column, the name of the account, for which\ncash is received is recorded. Similarly, on the credit side, the name of account for\nwhich cash is paid, is recorded. In the amount column the actual cash paid or\nreceived is recorded. At the end of the month, cash book is balanced. The cash\nbook is balanced in the same manner an account is balanced in the ledger. The\ntotal of the debit side of the cash book is compared with the total of the credit side\nand the difference, if any, is entered on the credit side of the cash book under the\nparticulars column as ‘balance c/d’. In case of Simple Cash Book, the total of\ndebit side is always more than the total of the credit side, since the payment can\nnever exceed the available cash. The difference is written in the amount column\nand total of the both sides of the cash book becomes equal. The closing balance\nof the credit side becomes the opening balance for the next period and is written\nas Balance b/d on the Debit side of the Cash Book for the following period.\nRecording  of  cash  transactions  in  the  Simple  Cash  Book  and  its  balancing  is\nillustrated with the help of the following illustrations :\nCash Book"

This balance\namount is called ‘Bank overdraft’. It is written on the credit side of the bank column of\nthe cash book as opening balance.

These\norganisations appoint an assistant to the Head Cashier. The appointed cashier is known\nas petty cashier. He makes payments of these expenses and maintains a separate cash\nbook to record these transactions. Such a cash book is called Petty Cash Book. The\npetty cashier works on the imprest system. Under this system, a definite sum, say `\n4000/- is given to the petty cashier at the beginning of the period. This amount is called\nimprest money. The petty cashier meets all small payments out of this imprest amount,\nAt the end of the period say one month he presents the account to the Head Cashier\nand gets reimbursed from the Head Cashier. Suppose out of ` 4,000 he has spent `\n3,850 by the end of the month. He will get ` 3,850 from the head cashier. Thus, again\nhe has the full imprest amount in the beginning of the next period. The process of\nreimbursement can be weekly, fortnightly or monthly depending upon the frequency of\nsmall payments. The Petty Cashier is authorised to sanction and disburse small payments.\nAssignment of the task of making of petty expenses to a person and the maintenance of\npetty cash book by him reduces the burden of the Head Cashier.\nThe petty cash book has a number of columns for the amount on the payment side.\nEach of the amount columns is allotted to items of specific payments, which are common.\nThe last column is allotted for miscellaneous payments. At the end of the period, all\namount columns are totalled. The total of the amount paid shown in column 5 is deducted\nfrom the column 1. At the opening of the month the total amount paid in the previous\nmonth is reimbursed by the Head Cashier.\nFormat of a Petty Cash Book is given as under:\nPetty Cash Book (Format)\nAmount    DateParticularsVoucherAmountAnalysis of Payments\nReceivedNo,paid (Rs)\nPostageTeleConveyStationMiscella\nphoneanceeryneous\nTelegramExpenses\n      1   2        3   45  678910\nCash Book"

If you attempt to solve any other type of problem you want to ensure\nthat it has been correctly solved. For this you try to find out some ways or means.\nSimilarly an accountant also wants to be sure that the ledger accounts he/she has\nprepared are correct in respect of amount, side, balance, etc. To check the accuracy\nof posting in the ledger a statement is prepared. This statement is called Trial Balance.\nYou also know that accounts are prepared by applying double entry system. According\nto this system every debit of a transaction has corresponding credit for the same amount.\nHence, the total of debit balances of different accounts in the ledger must be equal to\nthe total of the credit balances in the remaining accounts, provided transactions have\nbeen correctly posted in the ledger. A statement is prepared containing these balances\nwith two columns i.e. debit column containing debit balances and credit column containing\ncredit balances and the debit column total is compared with credit column total. If the\ncolumnar totals are same it implies that ledger accounts are arithmetically accurate.\nIn this lesson, you will learn about meaning, objectives and preparation of Trial Balance.\nAfter studying this lesson you will be able to :\nzstate the meaning of Trial Balance;\nzexplain the objectives of preparing Trial Balance\nzprepare a Trial Balance as per the format;\nzidentify the need for a Suspense A/c in case the Trial Balance does not tally and\nzinfer the possibility of errors even if the Trial Balance tallies.\nOBJECTIVES"

Finally, at the end of the accounting year these accounts are\nbalanced. To check the accuracy of  posting in the ledger a statement is prepared with\ntwo columns i.e. debit column and credit column which contains debit balances of\naccounts and credit balances of accounts respectively. Total of the two columns are if\nequal, it means the ledger posting is arithmetically correct. This statement is called Trial\nBalance.\nTrial Balance may be defined as a statement which contains balances of all\nledger accounts on a particular date.\nTrial Balance consists of a debit column with all debit balances of accounts and credit\ncolumn with all credit balances of accounts. The totals of these columns if tally it is\npresumed that ledger has been maintained correctly. However, Trial Balance proves\nonly the arithmetical accuracy of posting in the ledger.\nObjectives of Preparing a Trial Balance\nFollowing are the objectives of preparing Trial Balance\n(i)To Check Arithmetical Accuracy : Arithmetical accuracy in ledger posting means\nwriting correct amount, in the correct account and on its correct side while posting\ntransactions from various original books of accounts, such as Cash Book,\nPurchases Book, Sales Book, etc. It also means not only the correct balance of\nledger account but also the totals of the special purpose Books.\n(ii)   To Help in Preparing Financial Statements : The ultimate objective of the\naccounting is to prepare financial statements i.e. Trading and Profit and Loss\nAccount, and Balance sheet of a business  enterprise at the end of an accounting\nyear. These statements contain balances of various ledger accounts. As Trial\nBalance contains balances of all ledger accounts, in financial statements the balances\nof ledger accounts are carried from the Trial balance for proper analysis.\n(iii)Helps in Locating Errors : If total of two columns of the trial balance agrees it\nis a proof of arithmetical accuracy in the ledger posting. However, if the totals of\nthe two columns do not tally it indicates that there are some mistake in the ledger\naccounts. This prompts the accountant to find out the errors.\n(iv)Helps in Comparison : Comparison of ledger account balances of one year\nwith the corresponding balances with the previous year helps the management\ntaking some important decisions. This is possible by using the Trial Balances of\nthe two years.\nTrial Balance"

If the totals do not tally it\nmeans there are some errors in recording and/or in posting in the ledger of the business\ntransactions.\nThe reasons due to which the totals of the two columns of Trial balance may not agree\ncan be listed as follows :\n(i)The totals of the Special Purpose Books like Sales Book, Purchases Book, etc\nare not done correctly or there is some mistake in the posting of these totals in\ntheir respective accounts in the ledger.\n(ii)The items from different Special Purpose Books and Journal may be posted to\nthe wrong side of the account or a wrong amount is posted or posted to the\nwrong account.\n(iii)The balancing of an account is not done correctly.\n(iv)There may be mistake in carrying balance from the ledger account to the Trial\nBalance.\nYou may conclude that if the trial balance is in agreement, the business transactions\nhave been correctly recorded or posted into ledger. However, the agreement of Trial\nBalance is not a conclusive proof of the correctness of recording and posting of business\ntransactions. There can be errors and the sum of each column of the Trial Balance may\nstill be equal. As you have learnt that business transactions are so recorded that all\ndebits have the credits for the same amount and vice-a-versa. So the Trial Balance\nmust necessarily agree. But if the debits are matched by credits though there are mistakes\nin recording and posting the Trial balance will still agree. For example, if goods have\nbeen purchased from Surender, and if not entered in the Purchases Book, this error\nwill not affect the agreement of the Trial Balance.\nTrial Balance and Suspense A/c\nNow suppose the Trial Balance does not agree i.e. there is a difference of some amount\nin the totals of the two columns of the Trial Balance. What will you do with this difference?\nA different account i.e Suspense Account is opened with the difference in amount put in\nthis account. This will result in agreement of Trial Balance. The suspense account with\nthe amount of difference will be put on the shorter side of the Trial Balance. For example\ntotal of the debit column exceeds the total of the credit column by Rs.500. This amount\nof Rs 500 will be written on the credit column against Suspense Account to make the\nTrial Balance agree.\nTrial Balance"

As the time period of posting\nthe transactions in the bank column of cash book does not correspond with the time\nperiod of posting in the bank pass book of the firm, the difference arises. The reasons\nfor difference in balance of the cash book and pass book are as under :\ni.Cheques Issued By The Firm But Not Yet Presented For Payment : When\ncheques are issued by the firm, these are immediately entered on the credit side\nof the bank column of the cash book. Sometimes, receiving person may present\nthese cheques to the bank for payment on some later date. The bank will debit\nthe firm’s account when these cheques are presented for payment. There is a\ntime period between the issue of cheque and being presented in the bank for\npayment. This may cause difference to the balance of cash book and pass book.\nii.Cheques Deposited into Bank But Not Yet Collected : When cheques are\ndeposited into bank, the firm immediately enters it on the debit side of the bank\ncolumn of cash book. It increases the bank balance as per the cash book. But,\nthe bank credits the firm’s account after these cheques are actually realised. A\nfew days are taken in clearing of local cheques and in case of outstation cheques\nfew more days are taken. This may cause the difference between cash book\nand pass book balance.\niii.Amount Directly Deposited in The Bank Account : Sometimes, the debtors\nor the customers deposit the money directly into firm’s bank account, but the\nfirm gets the information only when it receives the bank statement. In this case,\nthe bank credits the firm’s account with the amount received but the same amount\nis not recorded in the cash book. As a result the balance in the cash book will\nbe less than the balance shown in the Pass book.\niv.    Bank Charges : The bank charge in the form of fees or commission is charged\nfrom time to time for various services provided from the customers’ account\nwithout the intimation to the firm. The firm records these charges after receiving\nthe bank intimation or statement. Example of such deductions is : Interest on\noverdraft balance, credit cards’ fees, outstation cheques, collection charges, etc.\nAs a result, the balance of the cash book will be more than the balance of the\npass  book.\nv.Interest and Dividend Received by the Bank : Sometimes, the interest on\ndebentures  or  dividends  on  shares  held  by  the  account  holder  is  directly\ndeposited by the company through Electronic Clearing System (ECS). But the\nfirm does not get the information till it receives the bank statement. As a\nconsequence, the firm enters it in its cash book on a date later than the date\nit is recorded by the bank. As a result, the balance as per cash book and pass\nbook will differ.\nBank Reconciliation Statement"

Direct  Payments  Made  By  The  Bank  On  Behalf  Of  The  Customers  :\nSometimes, bank makes certain payments on behalf of the customer as per\nstanding instructions. Telephone bills, rent, insurance premium, taxes, etc are\nsome of the expenses. These expenses are directly paid by the bank and debited\nto the firm’s account immediately after their payment. but the firm will record\nthe same on receiving information from the bank in the form of Pass Book or\nbank statement. As a result, the balance of the pass book is less than that of\nthe balance shown in the bank column of the cash book.\nvii.   Dishonour of Cheques/Bill discounted : If a cheque deposited by the firm\nor bill receivable discounted with the bank is dishonoured , the same is debited\nto firm’s account by the bank. But the firm records the same when it receives\nthe information from the bank. As a result, the balance as per cash book and\nthat  of pass book will differ.\nviii.  Errors Committed in Recording Transactions by the Firm : There may be\ncertain errors from firm’s side, e.g., omission or wrong recording of transactions\nrelating to cheques deposited, cheques issued and wrong balancing etc. In this\ncase, there would be a difference between the balances as per Cash Book and\nas  per  Pass  Book.\nix.

These\nerrors may be in the form of omitting the transactions to record, recording in wrong\nbooks, or wrong account or wrong totalling and so on.\nAccounting  errors  can  take  the  following  forms:\nzOmission of recording a business transaction in the Journal or Special purpose\nBooks\nzNot posting the recorded transactions in various books of accounts to the respective\naccounts in ledger\nzMistakes in totalling or in carrying forward the totals to the next page\nzMistake in recording amount wrongly, writing it in a wrong account or on the\nwrong side of the account.\nAgain there may be two types of accounting errors (i) That cause the disagreement of\ntrial balance, (ii) That do not affect the agreement of Trial Balance.\nLocating Errors\nIt is obvious that if there are errors they must be located at the earliest. After locating\nthe errors, they are to be rectified. In accounting also once it is established there are\nsome accounting errors these need to be located and detected as early as possible.\nHow to locate the errors?\nSteps to be taken to locate the accounting errors can be stated as follows:\n(A) When the Trial Balance does not Agree\n(i)Check the columnar totals of Trial Balance\n(ii)Check that the balances of all accounts (including cash and bank balances) in the\nledger have been written and are written in the correct column of trial balance i.e.\ndebit balance in the debit column and credit balance in the credit column.\n(iii)Find the exact figure of difference with trial balance and see that:\n(a)   No account of a similar balance has been omitted to be shown in the Trial\nBalance or\n(b)   A balance amount which is half of the amount of difference amount but is\nwritten on the wrong side of the trial Balance.\n(iv)Recheck the totals of Special Purpose Books.\n(v)   Check the balancing of the various accounts in the ledger.\nErrors and Their Rectification"

There may still be some accounting\nerrors. These errors may not be immediately traced but may be detected at much later\nstage. These are rectified as and when detected.\nFollowing are the errors which don’t affect the trial balance :\n(i)Omission to record a transaction in a journal or in a Special Purpose Book. For\nexample, goods purchased on credit but are not recorded in the Purchases Book\nat all.\n(ii)Recording a wrong amount of an item in journal or in a Special Purpose Book.\nFor example, sale of ` 2550 on credit entered in the Sales Book as ` 5250.\n(iii)Posting the correct amount on the correct side but in wrong account. For example,\ncash received from Jagannathan was credited to Vishvanathan.\n(iv)   An item of Capital Expenditure recorded as an item of Revenue Expenditure and\nvice-a-versa. For example, Repairs to Building was debited to Building A/c.\nWhy does the trial balance still agree though there may be above stated errors? Reason\nis that in the above cases the debits and credits are affected simultaneously by the same\namount.\nDo the following errors affect the trial balance or do not affect the trial balance?\nWrite ‘Yes’ if it affects and ‘No’ if does not affect.\ni.Sold goods of ` 3200 to Anil Nayar, but it is not entered in the Sales Book.\nii.Purchased goods of ` 2400 from Simran and is correctly entered in the Purchases\nBook but posted to the credit of her account in the ledger as `3400.\niii.Total of the Purchases Book is incorrect.\niv.An amount of repair to building is debited to Building Account.\n \n12.2  CLASSIFICATION  OF  ACCOUNTING  ERRORS\nVarious accounting errors can be classified as follows :\nA.

On the basis of their impact on ledger accounts\n(a) One sided errors\n(b) Two sided errors.\nA. On the basis of their nature\n(a)   Errors of omission : \nAs a rule, a transaction is first recorded in books of accounts.\nHowever, accountant may not record it at all or record it partially. It is called an\nerror of omission. For example, goods purchased on credit are not recorded in\nPurchases Book or discount allowed to a customer was not posted to Discount\nA/c in the ledger.\nIn the first case it is a complete omission. Therefore, both debit and credit are\naffected by the same amount. Therefore, it does not affect the Trial Balance.\nThe second example is the example of partial omission. It affects only one account\ni.e. Discount A/c. Therefore it affects Trial Balance.\n(b)   Errors of commission : When the transaction has been recorded but an error is\ncommitted in the process of recording, it is called an error of commission. Error of\ncommission can be of the following types:\n(i)Errors committed while recording a transaction in the Special Purpose books.\nIt may be :\nzRecording in the wrong book for example purchase of goods from\nRakesh on credit is recorded in the Sales Book and not in the Purchases\nBook.\nzRecording in the book correctly but wrong amount is written. For\nexample, goods sold to Shalini of ` 4200 was recorded in the Sales\nBook as ` 2400\nIn the above two cases two accounts are affected by the same amount, debit\nof one and the credit of the other. Therefore, trial balance will not be affected.\n(ii)    Wrong totalling : There may be a mistake in totalling Special Purpose Book\nor accounts. The totalled amounts may be less than the actual amount or\nmore than the actual amount. First is a case of undercasting and the other of\novercasting. For example, the total of Purchases Book is written as ` 44800\nwhile actual total is ` 44300, the total of Sales Day Book is written as `52500\nwhile it is ` 52900.\nErrors and Their Rectification"

      "content": "233\nNotes\nACCOUNTANCY\nMODULE  -  2\nTrial Balance and\nComputers\nIt is a case of an error affecting one account hence it affects trial balance.\n(iii)   Wrong balancing : While closing the books of accounts at the end of the\naccounting period, the ledger accounts are balanced. Balance is calculated\nof the totals of the two sides of the account. It may be wrongly calculated.\nFor example, the total of the debit column of Mohan’s A/c is ` 8,600 and\nthat of credit column is ` 6,800. The balance calculated is as ` 1,600 while\nthe actual balance is `1,800.\nIt has affected one account only, therefore, the Trial Balance gets affected.\n(iv)   Wrong carry forward of balances or totals : Totals or balances are carried\nforward to the next page. These may be carried forward incorrectly. For\nexample, the total of one page of the Purchases  Book of ` 35,600 is carried\nto next page as ` 36,500.\nAgain the error affects one account only. Therefore, Trial Balance gets\naffected.\n(v)   Wrong Posting : Transactions from the journal or special purpose books are\nposted to the respective accounts in the ledger. Error may be committed\nwhile carrying out posting. It may take various forms such as, posting to\nwrong account, to the wrong side of the account or posted twice to the same\naccount. For example goods purchased of ` 5400 from Rajesh Mohanti\nwas posted to the debit of Rajesh Mohanti or posted twice to his account or\nposted to the credit of Rakesh Mohanti.\nIn the above examples, only one account is affected because of the error\ntherefore, Trial Balance is also affected.\nCompensating Errors\nTwo or more errors when committed in such a way that there is increase or decrease in\nthe debit side due to an error, also there is corresponding decrease or increase in the\ncredit side due to another error by the same amount. Thus, the effect on the account is\ncancelled out. Such errors are called compensating errors. For example, Sohan’s A/c\nis debited by ` 2500 while it was to be debited by ` 3500 and Mohan’s A/c is debited\nby ` 3500 while the same was to be debited by ` 2500. Thus, excess debit of Mohan’s\nA/c by `1000 is compensated by short credit of Sohan’s A/c by `1000.\nAs the debit amount and the credit amount are equalised, such errors do not affect the\nagreement of Trial Balance, but the fact remains that there is still an error.\n(c)   Error of Principle : Items of income and expenditure are divided into capital\nand revenue categories. This is the basic principle of accounting that the capital\nreceipts and capital expenditure should be recorded as capital item and revenue\nErrors and Their Rectification"

      "pageNumber": 244,
      "content": "234\nNotes\nMODULE  -  2\nTrial Balance and\nComputers\nACCOUNTANCY\nincome and revenue expenditure should be recorded as revenue item. If transactions\nare recorded in violation of this principle, it is called error of principle i.e. the\ncapital item has been recorded as revenue item and revenue item is recorded as\ncapital item. For example, ` 5000 spent on the repairs of building is debited to\nBuilding A/c while it should have been debited to Repair to Building A/c. It is a\ncase of error of principle because expenditure on repairs of building is a revenue\nexpenditure, while it has been debited to Building A/c taking it as an item of capital\nexpenditure.\nAs both the sides i.e. credit as well as debit remain affected, the trial Balance also is not\naffected by such errors.\nB. On the basis of impact on ledger accounts\nErrors may affect one side i.e. either debit or credit side of an account or its two sides\ni.e. both debit and credit thus errors may be divided as:\n(a)   One sided errors : Accounting errors that affect only one side of an account\nwhich may be either its debit side or credit side, is called one sided error. The\nreason of such error is that while posting a recorded transaction one account is\ncorrectly posted while the corresponding account is not correctly posted. For\nexample, Sales Book is overcast by ` 1000. In this case only Sales A/c is wrongly\ncredited by excess amount of ` 1000 while the corresponding account of the\nvarious debtors have been correctly debited. Another example of one sided error\nis ` 2500 received from Ishita is wrongly debited to her account. In this case, only\nIshita’s account is affected, amount in the cash-book is correctly written. This\ntype of error does affect the trial balance.\n(b)   Two sided errors : The error that affects two separate accounts, is called two\nsided error. Example of such error is purchase of machinery for ` 1000 has been\nentered in the Purchases Book. In this case, Purchases A/c is wrongly debited\nwhile Machinery A/c has been omitted to be debited. So two accounts i.e.\nPurchases A/c and the Machinery A/c are affected.\nFollowing are some accounting errors. Write against each error the type i.e. error of\nomission, error of principle, compensatory error, error of commission as per the nature\nof error:\n(i)Purchase of Furniture is entered in the Purchase Book(Error of ............)\n(ii)Repairs of building is debited to Building A/c.(Error of ............)\n(iii)Sales Book is totalled ` 15,000 instead of its ` 14,600.

This information will\nbe most useful only if the information is accurate. How can the business concern achieve\nthis objective if there are number of errors in the accounting? Your immediate response\nwill be that errors in accounts should be detected at the earliest and be corrected\nbefore preparing the financial statements.\nIt should be clear in your mind that the errors should never be rectified by erasing or\noverwriting because it will encourage manipulations and frauds in accounts.\nIn accounting practice there are some definite methods to rectify the accounting errors.\nThese are based on accounting practices and procedures. Rectification of errors using\nthese methods is called rectification of accounting errors. So it is a process of rectification.\nIt is generally done by passing an entry to nullify the effect of error.\nMethods of rectification of accounting errors :\nI.    Before preparing Trial Balance\n(i) instant correction(ii) correction in the affected account\nII.   After preparing Trial Balance\nI.Before preparing Trial Balance\n(i)    Instant correction : If the error is detected immediately after making an\naccounting entry, it may be corrected by neatly crossing out the wrong entry\nand making the correct entry and the accountant should put his initials. For\nexample, an amount of ` 3,500 is written as ` 5,300. This can be corrected\nas ` 3,500.\n(ii)Correction in the affected accounts : In case error is detected on a date\nlater than the date on which the transaction was recorded but before the Trial\nBalance, the rectification will be made by making a correction in the affected\naccount. A few Illustrations of accounting errors corrected by this method\nare as follows :\nIllustration 1\nPurchases book is overcast for the month of July, 2014 by ` 8,000.\nErrors and Their Rectification"

It means the sum of its debit column and sum of credit column\nshould agree. But if the totals do not agree the difference amount is written in a new\naccount. This account is called Suspense Account. If the total of the debit side of the\nTrial Balance is more than the total of its credit side, the difference amount will be\nwritten in Suspense A/c on its credit side i.e. Suspense A/c is credited and vice-versa.\nYou have also learnt that the two sides of the Trial Balance do not agree because there\nis some error or errors in the accounts, which is reflected in the Suspense Account.\nThus, Suspense A/c is a summarised account showing net effect of errors.\nOpening of a Suspense Account is a temporary arrangement. As soon as the errors\nthat has led to creation of Suspense Account are rectified, this account will disappear.\nOne point needs to be noted that balance shown in Suspense Account is the net result\nof one sided errors. So one sided errors are corrected through Suspense A/c. Completing\nINTEXT  QUESTIONS  12.3\nErrors and Their Rectification"

In\nthe course of this evolution, they have become faster, smaller, cheaper, more\nreliable and user friendly.\n  13.2  COMPONENTS  OF  COMPUTER\nA computer consists of the major components i.e., Input Unit, Central Processing Unit\nand Output Unit. Diagrammatically, these components may be presented as follows:\nComponents of Computer\nzz\nzz\nz\nInput Unit : Input unit is controlling the various input devices which are used\nfor entering data into the computer. The mostly used input devices are keyboard,\nmouse, and scanner. Other such devices are magnetic tape, magnetic disk, light\npen, bar code reader, smart card reader, etc. Besides, there are other devices\nwhich respond to voice and physical touch. Physical touch system is installed\nat airport for obtaining the online information about departure and arrival of flight.\nThe input unit is responsible for taking input and converting it into binary system.\nzz\nzz\nz\nCentral  Processing  Unit  (CPU)  :  The  CPU  is  the  control  centre  for  a\ncomputer. It guides, directs and governs its performance. It is the brain of the\ncomputer.

This is\nused to store program, photos, graphics, and data and obey the instructions in\nprogram. It is divided into three subunits :\n(a)   Control Unit : Control unit controls and co-ordinates the activities of all\nthe components of the computer. This unit accepts input data and converts it\ninto computer binary system.\n(b)   Memory Unit : This unit stores data before being actually processed.

The accountant is required to prepare summary of transac-\ntions and financial statements manually. The advanced technology involves various\nmachines capable of performing different accounting functions, for example, a billing\nmachine. This machine is capable of computing discount, adding net total and posting\nthe requisite data to the relevant accounts.\nWith substantial increase in the number of transactions, a machine was developed which\ncould store and process accounting data in no time. Such advancement leads to num-\nber of growing successful organisations. A newer version of machine is evolved with\nincreased speed, storage, and processing capacity. A computer to which they were\nconnected operated these machines. As a result, the maintenance of accounting data\non a real-time basis became almost essential. Now maintaining accounting records\nbecome more convenient with the computerised accounting.\nThe computerised accounting uses the concept of databases. For this purpose an ac-\ncounting software is used to implement a computerised accounting system. It does\naway the necessity to create and maintain journals, ledgers, etc., which are essential\npart of manual accounting. Some of the commonly used accounting softwares are Tally,\nCash Manager, Best Books, etc.\nAccounting software is used to implement computerised accounting. The computer-\nised accounting is based on the concept of database. It is basic software which allows\naccess to the data contained in the data base. It is a system to manage collection of\ndata ensuring at the same time that it remains reliable and confidential.\nFollowing are the components of Computerised accounting software:\n1.Preparation  of  Accounting  Documents  : Computer  helps  in  preparing\naccounting documents like Cash Memo, Bills and invoices etc., and preparing\naccounting vouchers.\n2.Recording of Transactions : Every day business transactions are recorded\nwith the help of computer software. Logical scheme is implied for codification\nof account and transaction. Every account and transaction is assigned a unique\ncode. The grouping of accounts is done from the first stage. This process\nsimplifies the work of recording the transactions.\nComputer & Computerised Account System"

The financial statements prepared without rectifying such errors\nwill reveal incorrect financial results and position. Therefore, extreme caution needs to\nbe exercised when grouping of accounts is done and also when the transaction is\nrecorded using computers.\nThe process of ‘Grouping of Accounts’ is the basic or fundamental requirement for\nproducing financial statements. The second stage of application of computers in\naccounting is to record individual transactions using the accounting software. But always\nbear in mind that accounting concepts shall always be followed.\nUsing Software of CAS\nThere are two basic activities in using software of CAS - One time activities and recurring\nactivities. One time activities include creation of Organisation details, accounting year,\ntype of ledger (also called “creation of master files”), et. While recurring activities\ninclude entry of transactions and generation of reports. The transactions are recorded\non the basis of Cash Vouchers, Bank Vouchers, Purchase Vouchers, Sales Vouchers,\nJournal Vouchers, etc. Reports include generation of Day books, Ledger, Trial Balance,\nProfit and Loss Account, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement.\nSecurity Features of CAS Software\nEvery accounting software ensures data security, safety and confidentiality. Therefore\nevery, software provides the following:\nzPassword Security : Password is a mechanism, which enables a user to access\na system including data. The system facilitates defining the user rights according to\norganisation policy. Consequently, a person in an organisation may be given access\nto a particular set of a data while he may be denied access to another set of data.\nPassword is the key (code) to allow the access to the system.\nzData Audit : This feature enables one to know as to who and what changes have\nbeen made in the original data thereby helping and fixing the responsibility of the\nperson who has manipulated the data and also ensures data integrity. Basically,\nthis feature is similar to Audit Trial.\nzData Vault : Software provides additional security through data encryption.\nEncryption  essentially  scrambles  the  information  so  as  to  make  its\ninterpretation extremely difficult (almost impossible). Thus, Encryption\nensures  security  of  data  even  if  it  lands  in  wrong  hands,  because  the\nreceiver of data will not be able to decode and interpret it.\nComputer & Computerised Account System"

Let us discuss these.\ni.Payroll Processing  : Payroll Procesing means preparation of salaries and wages,\naccounting along with the leave records, deduction of provident fund, ESI, etc.\nLeave records are part of payroll as salaries and wages are prepared taking into\naccount the leaves taken. ESI and Provident Fund are statutory deductions out of\nsalaries and wages and also contribution by the employers.\nComputer takes the data such as Employee’s Name, Father’s Name, Employee\ncode, Basic Salary, Perquisites, Percentage of deduction for Provident Fund, ESI\nand advance, etc., from the Master Data and the number of days from the\nattendance record. It not only produces the salary and wages sheet timely but\nalso accurately. The entry in the financial books of account is recorded from the\npayroll processing.\nii.Transaction Recording : Transactions are recorded using the utility or application\nsoftware. Transaction recording under the computerised environment is not only\naccurate but is also less time consuming. It is so because two time consuming\nprocesses under the manual system namely posting of entries into ledger accounts\nand casting (totalling and balancing) are automated by the software. Software are\ndesigned in the manner that the process of posting and casting is carried out\nsimultaneously with recording of transaction.\nA functional key is provided to record transactions relating to cash, purchase, sale\nand journal. It means that if cash transactions are to be recorded the functional\nkey when operated will open the cash book.\niii.    Ledger : The software is designed in such a manner that the transaction is posted\nto the ledger account and the ledger account is casted simultaneously with the\nrecording of transaction.

The computerised\naccounting system can store and process such voluminous transactions with speed\nand accuracy.\nii.Scalability : A computerised accounting system is scalable to handle the growing\ntransactions.\niii.    Security : The accounting data under the computerised environment is safer than\nthe accounting data under the manual system. The data can be kept secure by\nusing a password, i.e., allowing only authorised users to access the data.\niv.    Timely Reporting : Availability of reports on time enables the management to\ntake quick decisions, which is an important element for the success of an enterprise.\nA computerised accounting system makes these reports available as and when\nrequired.\nv.Lower Cost : The cost of maintaining books of accounts under the computerised\nprocess is lower than in comparison to the manual process.\nvi.    Less Paper Work : Under the computerised process, there is less paper work\nas compared to the paper work in the manual process.\nvii.Flexible Reporting : Reporting under the computerised process is flexible in\ncomparison to the manual process. The database can be processed further to\nobtain the desired report. For example, data relating to debtors can be analysed\nto ascertain the list of customers to whom sales above Rs. 1,00,000 has been\nmade in an accounting year or of the regular customers of the enterprises and so\non.\nviii. Queries : Replies to queries based on external factors can be obtained easily\nunder a computerised process. For example, list of debtors who have not paid on\ntime can be taken out by processing the database.\nix.    Accurate : Computer statements are far more accurate in comparison to manual\nstatements.\nx.Updating : Updating and treatment of wrong transactions are easily done.\nxi.

Let us discuss the processes  of under the\ntwo accounting processes, i.e., manual process and computerised process, for the\npurpose of comparison.\nzIdentifying Financial Transactions : Identifying Financial Transactions and\nrecording them in the books of accounts by applying the principle of accounting is\na manual process carried out by an authorised person or on the basis of the\naccounting manual. This process is, thus, common under both the processes.\nzRecording : The process of Recording transaction in the books of original entry,\nposting them in the ledger accounts, performing mathematical functions, i.e., adding,\nsubtraction and totalling, are carried out manually under the manual process. In\nthe computerised process, transactions are recorded in the books of accounts\nand the remaining functions are performed without any further process or command\nbeing carried out manually.\nzClassification : In the manual process, the transactions are recorded in the book\nof original entry and are posted into the ledger accounts. It means that, after\nrecording the transaction, another process of posting process is carried out by\ninternal sorting of data, i.e., with the help of utility or application software, without\nany further process.\nzSummarising : In the manual system of accounting, the data under each Ledger\nis summarised and a balance of each account is ascertained to prepare a Trial\nBalance. As a result, preparing ledger accounts is essential to prepare a Trial\nBalance. In the computerised process, a transaction or event, once recorded, is\nstored in the database and can be processed to produce a Trial Balance directly.\nzAdjustments Entries : Adjustment Entries are passed to rectify an error or to\nfollow the matching concept of accounting, i.e., matching the cost with revenue,\nThe process of passing adjustment entries can be equated with the recording\nprocess. These entries are identified and recorded in the books of accounts. The\nremaining process is the same as discussed above.\nComputer & Computerised Account System"

Once this decision is taken, the account is\ngrouped as an asset, a liability, an income or an expense at the time of preparing\nthe financial statements. The above process is followed when the manual system\nof accounting is adopted. However, in computerised accounting, whether an\naccount head is an asset, a liability, an income or an expense, is decided at the\ntime the transaction takes place, as in the case of manual accounting. It is also\ndefined whether the particular head of account shall be shown as an asset or\nliability, or an income or expense.\nzFinancial Statements : In the manual process, availability of the Trial Balance is\nessential to prepare the Financial Statements. In the computerised process, financial\nstatements are generated from the system itself and, hence, there is no need to\nhave a Trial Balance.\nDifference between Manual Accounting and Computerised Accounting\nPoint of DifferenceManual  AccountingComputerised  Accounting\n1.

Since, the\nreadymade softwares are for general user, it is not necessary that all the modules\nof such softwares are of use for every user. It is likely that a particular module say\n‘Payroll’ may not be used because the enterprise has very few employees. Similarly,\na service enterprise will not require VAT module while a retail enterprise will not\nrequire Service Tax module. Some of the Readymade Software available are\nTally, Ex, Busy and Professional Accountant. Out of these, Tally is very widely\nused.\nReadymade Software has its own advantages and disadvantages. \nThe advantages\nare :\ni.Readymade  Softwares  are  economical  : Readymade  Software  are\nprepared  not  for  particular  user  but  for  the  user  in  general.  It  means\ndevelopment cost of the software is not loaded on a single software for\ndetermining the cost and thus selling price. The price of the software is\ndetermined on the basis of number of pieces expected to be sold. On the\nother hand, user specific softwares are expensive as the development cost is\nloaded on one software.\nii.Readymade Software are Available off-the-shelf : It therefore, saves\ntime that may be required for development of tailor-made softwares or for\ncustomisation. Development of a software consumes considerable time both\nat the user end and software development end. User will have to explain its\nrequirements to software developer who on the basis of his understanding\nwill develop software, test it with a dummy data, debug the software to the\nbest of his understanding before handing it to the user. All these activities\nconsume time. On the other hand, Readymade Software requires only\ninstallation and are ready for use.\niii.Readymade Software are Development by a Group of Experienced\nProfessionals : \nIt therefore, addresses the problem that may get overlooked\nif the user specific software is developed.\niv.

Printing by laserjet\nprinters is more expensive than Dot-Matrix printers.\nii.Normally, Readymade Softwares do not have the facility of secondary back-\nup. It means, in case of data loss, the entire data may not be recovered. But,\nthis limitation can be overcome by taking regular back-up of accounting data.\n2.Customised Software : The term Customised Software means making changes\nin the readymade software to suit the specific requirements of the user, i.e., making\nit user-specific. The software available off-the-shelf is modified to suit the\nrequirements of the user. For example, the design of the invoice is changed to\nspecifications of the user. The developer, to meet specific user requirements, can\nmodify all the readymade softwares. However, the user has to bear the cost of\nsuch changes.

The user should be\nable to run the software on a variety of computer environments and machines, that\nis, on any configuration of computers and available operating systems.\nii.Cost of Installation and Maintenance : It is a must to consider that the cost of\nthe accounting software, its relevant hardware and the maintenance, cost of addition\nof dodules, training of staff, updating of versions and data recovery in case of data\nfailure are negotiable and within the ability of the organization to afford it.\niii.    Size of Organization : An accounting system must be according to the size of the\norganization, i.e., volume of business transactions, multi-user requirements.\niv.    Ease of Adaptation and Training Needs : Some accounting softwares are\nuser-friendly and require a simple training to the users. However, some other\ncomplex software packages, linked to other information systems, require intensive\ntraining on a continuous basis. The software must be capable of attracting users.\nv.Expected Level of Secrecy (Software and Data) : Security features of an\naccounting system software are also important. Software should ensure that it\nprevents unauthorized access and manipulation of data. In tailored software, the\nuser rights may be restricted according to the departments and their relevant\naccounting software functions.\nvi.    Exporting/Importing Data Facility : The software should allow easy data transfer\noption for flexible reporting, such as transfer of information directly from the ledger\ninto the spreadsheet software like Lotus or Excel.\n   13.14   COMPUTERISED   ACCOUNTING\nTransaction processing system (TPS) is the first stage of computerised accounting\nsystem. The purpose of any TPS is to record, process, validate and store transactions\nthat occur in various functional areas of a business for subsequent retrieval and usage.\nTPS involves following steps in processing a transaction: Data Entry, Data Validation,\nProcessing and Revalidation, Storage, Information and Reporting.\nIt is one of the transaction processing systems which is concerned with financial\ntransactions only.

A bank customer operates an\nATM facility to make a withdrawal. The actions taken by the customer constitute\ndata which is processed after validation by the computerised personal banking\nsystem.\n2.Data Validation : It ensures the accuracy and reliability of input data by comparing\nthe same with some predefined standards or known data. This validation is made\nby  the  ‘Error  Detection’  and  ‘Error  Correction’  procedures.  The  control\nmechanism, wherein actual input data is compared with predetermined norm is\nmeant to detect errors while error correction procedures make suggestions for\nentering correct data input. The Personal Identification Number (PIN) of the\ncustomer is validated with the known data. If it is incorrect, a suggestion is made\nto indicate the PIN is invalid. Once the PIN is validated, the amount of withdrawal\nbeing made is also checked to ensure that it does not exceed a pre-specified limit\nof withdrawal.\n3.Processing  and  Revalidation  : The  processing  of  data  occurs  almost\ninstantaneously in case of Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) provided a valid\ndata has been fed to the system. This is called check input validity. Revalidation\noccurs to ensure that the transaction in terms of delivery of money by ATM has\nbeen duly completed. This is called check output validity.\n4.Storage : Processed actions, as described above, result into financial transaction\ndata i.e. withdrawal of money by a particular customer, are stored in transaction\ndatabase of computerized personal banking system. This makes it absolutely clear\nthat only valid transactions are stored in the database.\n5.Information : The stored data is processed making use of the Query facility to\nproduce desired information.\n6.Reporting : Reports can be prepared on the basis of the required information\ncontent according to the decision usefulness of the report.\nFill in the blanks with correct word/words :\ni.Computer hardware and ....................... need to be updated from time to time.\nINTEXT  QUESTIONS  13.2\nComputer & Computerised Account System"

The\nrequirement of stationery and books of accounts along with vouchers and\ndocuments is directly dependent on the volume of transactions beyond a certain\npoint. There is a dire need to reduce the paper work and dispense with large\nvolumes of books of accounts. This can be achieved by introducing computerised\naccounting system.\nzz\nzz\nz\nFlexible Reporting : The reporting is flexible in computerised accounting system\nas compared to manual accounting system.

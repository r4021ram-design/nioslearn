Education is an instrument of change. The right type\nof education at right time can bring about positivity in the outlook of society, attitudinal\nchanges to face the new/fresh challenges and the courage to face difficult situations.\nThis can be very effectively achieved by regular periodic curriculum renewal. A static\ncurriculum does not serve any purpose, as it does not cater to the current needs and\naspirations of the individual and society.\nFor this purpose only, educationists from all over the country come together at regular\nintervals to deliberate on the issues of changes needed and required. As an outcome of\nsuch deliberations, the National Curriculum Framework (NCF 2005) came out, which\nspells out in detail the type of education desirable/needed at various levels of education\n– primary, elementary, secondary or senior secondary.\nKeeping this framework and other national and societal concerns in mind, we have\ncurrently revised the curriculum of Economics course at Senior Secondary level, as\nper  the  Common  Core  Curriculum  provided  by  National  Council  of  Educational\nResearch and Training (NCERT) and the Council of Boards of School Education in\nIndia (COBSE) making it current and need based. Textual material production is an\nintegral and essential part of all NIOS programmes offered through open and distance\nlearning system. Therefore, we have taken special care to make the learning material\nuser friendly, interesting and attractive for you.\nI would like to thank all the eminent persons involved in making this material interesting\nand relevant to your needs.

The  primary  aim  of  the\neconomic activity is the production of goods and services with a view to make them available\nto masses. “Human activities which are performed in exchange for money or money’s worth\nare called economic activities”. The environment that facilitates these activities is known as\nEconomy.\nLiving in society also means that we must know how to organize our lives in perfect manner.\nWe  must  know  to  economise  our  precious  time  and  scare  resources.  You  must  also  learn\nhow to manage time also because in present scenario time is money.Similarly, when we make\nbudget for our home; we make the best use of the resources which are available to us. We\ncan  avoid  many  problems  in  this  way.  This  way  of  Management  of  Household  is  called\nEconomics but it is much more than making a Budget. A study of economics can describe\nall  aspects  of  a  country’s  economy,  such  as  how  a  country  uses  its  resources,  how  much\ntime labourers devote to work and leisure, the outcome of investing in industries or financial\nproducts, the effect of taxes on a population, and why businesses succeed or fail and many\nmore.\nThus, Economics is the branch of social science that deals in the study of making decisions\nin the presence of scarcity of resources in the economy particularly with regard to the human\nactivities  such  as  production,  consumption,  saving  and  investment.  It  is  a  complex  social\nscience  subject  that  uses  principles  of  mathematics,  physics,  statistics,  politics,  history,\nsociology, anthropology, psychology and philosophy etc.In the true sense, Economics is an\ninter-disciplinary subject which addresses both the positive (fact based) and normative (value\nbased) issues. The term ‘Economics’ is derived from two Greek words OIKOS and NEMEIN,\nmeaning the rule or law of the household. Economics therefore is concerned with  not just\nhow a nation allocates its resources to various uses but it ideals with the process by which\nthe productive capacity of these resources can be further increased and with the factors which\nin  the  past  have  led  to  sharp  fluctuations  in  the  rate  of  utilization  of  resources.\nHOW  DO  WE  DEFINE  ECONOMICS?\nThe Modern Science of Economics was born with the publication of Adam Smith’s “An\nEnquiry into the Nature and Causes of Wealth of the Nation -1776”.That is why, Adam\nSmith  is  known  as  the  Father  of  Modern  Economics.\n(i)"

Economics has\ntwo  main  streams  –  Microeconomics  and  Macroeconomics. Through  these  two  major\nfields, economics analyses how economies work and af\nfect - market, business, government,\npeople, and other parts of the society.

Indian  Economists  mainly  deal  with  the  various  concepts  of\nEconomics.\nThough  Economics  today  studies  a  wide  spectrum  of  issues  and  topics  but  if  we  take  an\noverall view, its essence has been very simple i.e. the betterment of human life on this beautiful\nplanet earth. In making the lives of masses, the Economists have been devising a number\nof theories and propositions as to how an Economy may maximise its worth and potential.\nSince ancient times many masterpieces were produced by great Economists who were trying\nto  improvise  better  ways  of  maximising  the  fruits  of  Economic  activities.  The  study  of\nEconomics has a common goal to search for possible ways and alternatives for the betterment\nof human life. Apart from this, economists also contribute in formulating some broad rational\ntheories  to  make  a  more  balanced  world.\nSome  of  the  renowned  Indian  Economists  are:\nzChanakya  (Kautilya):  He  was  an  Indian  teacher,  philosopher,  and  royal  advisor.\nOriginally,  a  professor  of  economics  and  political  science  at  the  ancient  Takshashila\nUniversity.Chanakya  is  traditionally  identified  as  “Kautilya”  or  “Vishnu  Gupta”,  who\nauthored  the  ancient  political  treatise  called  Arthashastra  (Economics).\nzMahavira: Economics in Jainism is influenced by the Mahavira and his principles and\nphilosophies. His philosophies have been used to explain the economics behind it. He was\nthe  last  of  the  24  Tirthankars,  who  spread  Jainism.\nzShri DadaBhai Naroji: He is fondly called the Grand Old Man of India. He was a pioneer\nin the field of Economics.

Study of economics is very useful\nto  achieve  these  goals.\nAt  NIOS,  students  are  introduced  to  the  subject  of  Economics  at  Secondary  stage.  The  level  at\nthis stage is elementary in nature. However, at the Sr. Secondary level, students will be exposed\nto more areas of economics. They are also expected to know the use of tables and graphs/statistical\ntools to understand and explain various concepts and theories of economics. Indian students can\nbe trained in their field in the Indian context as well as in the context of globalization process going\nin  today’s  world.\n2.  OBJECTIVES\nThe main objectives of learning Economics at Senior Secondary level are to enables the learners to:\nxTo  help  the  learners  understand  the  structure,  problems,  working  and  recent  changes  in  the\nIndian economy.\nxTo  help  the  learners  understand  principles,  laws  and  concepts  of  Economics.\nxTo  help  the  learners  understand  national  income  analysis  and  methods  used  in  calculating\nnational income.\nxTo  develop  positive  attitudes  for  economic  justice  among  the  masses  and  socio-economic\nreconstruction  of  the  country.\nxTo develop skills among the learners the use of statistical tools to analyse, interpret and explain\ndata  and  information.\n3.  COURSE  STRUCTURE\nThe  present  curriculum  in  Economics  has  been  distributed  into  two  parts  and  eleven  modules.\nPart I Consists of three modules, namely: Indian Economic Development, Current challenges before\nthe Indian Economy and Economic growth and Economic Development. Similarly Part-II consists\nof  eight  modules,  namely:  Statistical  Tools,  Introduction  to  Economics,  Consumer’s  Behaviour,\nProducer’s Behaviour, Market and Price Determination, National Income Accounting, Theory of\nIncome and Employment and money, Banking and Government Budget. Each module has been\ndivided further into different lessons.\nThe  number  of  lessons  and  suggested  study  time  are  as  follows:"

Economies are compared with each other on the basis of these\nfeatures. India as a distinct nation came into existence on 15th August 1947, called\nthe independence day of India which marked the end of British rule over India.\nAfter that, Independent India has completed 66 years of self rule on 15th August\n2013. This period is long enough to evaluate the position and performance of the\ncountry to enable comparison with other countries in the world as well as evaluate\nits own progress over the years. With this view in mind the current lesson provides\nthe features of Indian economy.\nOBJECTIVES\nAfter completing this lesson, you will be able to:\nzdescribe the characteristics or features of Indian economy;\nzexplain the problems faced by Indian economy;\nzexplain the role of agriculture in India; and\nzdescribe the growth of industry in India.\n1.1   FEATURES OF INDIAN ECONOMY\nLet us now list the features of Indian economy as follows:\n(i)    Low per capita income\n(ii)Heavy population pressure\n(iii)Dependence of population on agriculture"

Per capita\nincome is defined as the ratio of national income over population. It gives the idea\nabout the average earning of an Indian citizen in a year, even though this may not\nreflect the actual earning of each individual. India's per capita income for the year\n2012-2013 is estimated at ` 39,168. This comes to about ` 3,264 per month. If we\ncompare India's per capita income with other countries of the world then it can be\nseen that India is well behind many of them. For example, the per capita income\nof USA is 15 times more that of India while China's per capita income is more than\nthree times of India.\n(ii) Heavy population pressure\nIndia is world's second largest populated country after China. As per 2011 census\nIndia's population stands at more than 121 crores. It increased at a rate of 1.03\npercent during 1990-2001. The main cause of fast rise in India's population is the\nsharp decline in death rate while the birth rate has not decreased as fast. Death rate\nis defined as the number of people died per thousand of population while birth rate\nis defined as the number of people taking birth per thousand of population.\nIn 2010, the birth rate was 22.1 persons per one thousand population while the\ndeath rate was only 7.2 persons per one thousand population. Low death rate is\nnot a problem. In fact it is a sign of development. Low death rate reflects better\npublic health system. But high birth rate is a problem because it directly pushes the\ngrowth of population. After 1921, India's population increased very fast because\nbirth rate declined very slowly while death rate declined very fast. From 49 in 1921\nthe birth rate declined to 22.1 in 2010 while during the same time period, death rate\ndeclined from 49 to 7.2. Hence the population growth was very rapid in India.\nHeavy population pressure has become a major source of worry for India. It has\nput burden on the public exchequer to mobilize enough resources to provide public\neducation, health care, infrastructure etc.\n(iii) Dependence on Agriculture\nMajority of India's working population depend on agricultural activities to pursue\ntheir  livelihood.  In  2011  about  58  percent  of  India's  working  population  was"

In spite of this, the contribution of agriculture to India’s\ngross domestic product is a little over 17 percent. A major concern of agriculture\nin India is that productivity in this sector is very less. There are many reasons for\nthis. There is heavy population pressure on land to sustain huge number. Due to\npopulation pressure on land the per capita availability of land area is very low and\nnot viable for extracting higher output. Two, since per capita land availability is\nless, a majority of people are forced to become agricultural labour working at low\nwages.  Three,  Indian  agriculture  suffers  from  lack  of  better  technology  and\nirrigation  facilities.  Four,  mostly  people,  who  are  not  educated  or  not  trained\nproperly, are engaged in agriculture. So it adds to low productivity in agriculture.\nINTEXT QUESTIONS  1.1\nFill in the blanks\n1.

As per reports of government of India, in 2011-12 about 269.3\nmillion people in India were poor. This was about 22 percent of India's population.\nA person is termed poor if he/she is not able to consume the required amount of\nfood to get a minimum calorie value of 2400 in rural area and 2100 in urban area.\nFor this the person must earn the required amount of money as well to buy the food\nitems. The government has also estimated that the required amount of money is `\n816 in rural area and ` 1000 in urban area per head per month. This comes to about\n` 28 in rural area and ` 33 in urban area per head per day. This is called poverty\nline. This implies that 269.9 million people of India were not able to earn such little\namount in 2011-12.\nPoverty goes with inequality in income and wealth distribution. Very few in India\nposses materials and wealth while majority have control over no or very little\nwealth in terms of land holding, house, fixed deposits, shares of companies, savings\netc. Only top 5 percent of households control about 38 percent of total wealth in\nIndia while the bottom 60 percent of household has control over only 13 percent\nof the wealth. This indicates concentration of economic power in a very few hand.\nAnother issue linked to poverty is the problem of unemployment. One of the most\nimportant reasons of poverty in India is that there is lack of job opportunities for\nall the persons who are in the labour force of the country. Labour force comprises\nof the adult persons who are willing to work. If adequate number of jobs are not\ncreated every year, the problem of unemployment will grow. In India every year\nlarge number of people are added to the labour force due to increase in population,\nincrease in number of educated people, lack of expansion of industrial and service\nsector at the required speed etc.\nSo far we discussed the negative features. There are certain positive features of\nIndian economy as well. They are discussed below."

However, the required ratio was never generated in the first\nfour to five decades after independence. The simple reason being higher consumption\nof necessary items by the population of whom most happened to be poor and lower\nmiddle  income  class.  Collective  household  saving  was  very  less  due  to  this.\nConsumption of durable items was also very less. But in recent years things have\ncharged.  Economists  have  calculated  that  in  order  to  support  the  growing\npopulation, India requires 14 percent of its GDP to be invested. It is encouraging\nto note that the saving rate of India for the year 2011 stands at 31.7 percent. The\nratio of gross capital formation was 36.6 percent. This is possible because people\nare now able to save in banks, consume durable goods and there has been large\nscale investment taking place on public utilities and infrastructure.\n(vi) Planned economy\nIndia is a planned economy. Its development process has been continuing through\nfive year plan since the first plan period during 1951-56. The advantage of planning\nis  very  well  known.  Through  planning  the  country  sets  its  priorities  first  and\nprovides the financial estimates to achieve the same. Accordingly efforts are made\nto  mobilise  resources  from  various  sources  at  least  cost.  India  has  already\ncompleted eleven five year plan periods and the twelfth plan is in progress. After\nevery plan a review is made analysing the achievements and short falls. Accordingly,\nthings  are  rectified  in  the  next  plan.  Today  India  is  a  growing  economy  and\nrecognised every where as a future economic power. The per capita income of\nIndia is growing at a higher rate than before. India is seen as a big market for various\nproducts. All these are possible due to planning in India.\n1.2  ROLE OF AGRICULTURE IN INDIA\nAgriculture  is  one  of  the  most  important  sectors  of  Indian  economy.  It  is  the\nsupplier of food and raw materials in the country. At the time of independence more\nthan 70 per cent of India's population depended on agriculture to earn livelihood.\nAccordingly the share of agriculture in the national product/income was as high\nas 56.6 per cent in 1950-51. However with development of industries and service\nsector  during  the  plan  periods,  the  percentage  of  population  depending  on\nagriculture as well as the share of agriculture in the national product has come\ndown. In 1960, the percentage of labour force engaged in agricultural activities\nwas 74 which gradually came down over the years to 51 per cent in 2012. In 1960\nthe share of labour force in industry and service sectors stood at 11 and 15 percent"

But  in  2012  these  shares  increased  to  22.4  and  26.5  percent\nrespectively.  It  has  been  observed  in  most  of  the  economies  that  along  with\neconomic  development  shift  in  labour  force  from  agriculture  to  industry  and\nservice sector takes place.\nAgriculture  is  the  source  of  food  supply.  The  production  of  food  grains  has\nincreased from nearly 55 million tonnes in 1950-51 to 259 million tones in 2012-\n13. Because of the growth in food grain production, India's dependence on import\nof food grains has declined and almost become nil. Keeping in view the rapid\ngrowth in India's population, increase in food grain was a necessity which the\ncountry achieved significantly. Except for pulses, increase in food grains has been\nmode possible by increase in cereals and various cash crops.\nAgriculture is also a major source of foreign exchange earning through export. The\nshare of agriculture in India's export in the year 2011-12 was 12.3 percent. The\nmajor items of export include tea, sugar, tobacco, spices, cotton, rice, fruits and\nvegetables etc.\n1.3  GROWTH OF INDUSTRY IN INDIA\nIndustry or the secondary sector of the economy is another important area of\neconomic activity. After independence, the government of India emphasized the\nrole of industrialization in the country's economic development in the long run.\nAccordingly,  the  blue  print  for  industrial  development  was  made  through  the\nIndustrial  Policy  Resolution  (IPR)  in  1956.  The  1956  policy  emphasized  on\nestablishment of heavy industries with public sector taking the lead in this area.\nAdoption of heavy or basic industries strategy was justified on the ground that it\nwill  reduce  the  burden  on  agriculture,  enable  growth  in  the  production  of\nconsumer  goods  industries  as  well  as  small  industries  that  are  helpful  for\nemployment generation and achieving self reliance. After the adoption of the IPR,\n1956 there was tremendous growth in industrialization during the second and third\nplan periods i.e. 1956-61 and 1961-66. Public sector contributed maximum to this\ngrowth. But towards the end of 1960s, investment in industries was reduced which\nadversely  affected  its  growth  rate.  In  the  1980s,  this  trend  was  reversed  and\ninvestment in industries was increased by making the infrastructure base such as\npower, coal, rail much stronger.\nIn  early  1990s  it  was  found  that  the  public  sector  undertakings  were  not\nperforming upto expectation. There has been reports of mismanagement in these\nunder takings resulting in loss. So in 1991 the government of Indian decided to\nencourage the role of private sector in industrial development, remove the rigid\nlicence system which is known as liberalization and allow international players to\ncompete in the domestic country as well as  domestic players to explore foreign\nterritories.  The  aim  of  taking  all  these  steps  was  to  strengthen  the  process  of"

Such a model of industrial development is called\nLiberalization, Privatization and Globalization (LPG) model.\nAfter the adoption of this new policy in 1991, there has been phases of growth\nfollowed by slowdown in the industrial development process. In the early years of\n1990s there was significant growth in industrialization due to increase in investment\nin infrastructure, reduction in excise duty, availability of finance etc. But towards\nthe  end  of  1990s  the  growth  rate  slowed  down  due  to  stiff  competition  from\ninternational companies, inadequate infrastructure support etc. However, in the\nbeginning of the new millennium, between 2002-08 there was again some recovery\ndue to increase in saving rate from 23.5 percent in 2001-2 to 37.4 percent in 2007-\n08. Even the competition from the foreign companies helped during this phase as\nthe domestic companies could create enough internal strength in term of quality\ncontrol, finance and customer care etc. to withstand the competition. However\nafter  2008-09  there  was  some  slow  down  in  industrial  growth  due  to  rise  in\npetroleum price, interest rate and borrowings from abroad which has created lot\nof liabilities for the domestic companies.\nINTEXT QUESTIONS  1.2\n1.

The top priority issue which needs\nto be addressed immediately should be placed at number one and so on.\n(iii)The  next  step  is  to  identify  the  problems  which  are  to  be  solved  in  the\nimmediate short run and the other problems which are to be addressed over\nthe long period.\n(iv)Fixing a target to achieve the desired goal. The target could be a specified time\nperiod within which the problem must be solved. If the problem is to be\naddressed over long run, then it must be made clear that how much of the\nproblem be solved in the first period (say a year or six months) and so on.\nSecondly the target could be a certain quantity to be achieved. Say in case of\nproduction, the government can fix some target in terms of quantity.\n(v)   Estimating the amount of resources needed for achieving the target. Resources\ninclude financial resource, human resource, physical resource etc.\n(vi)Mobilizing  the  resources  is  another  important  task.  This  means  that  the\nplanners must know the sources of arranging the required resources. For\nexample, in case of financing the plan, the planners must make the budget and\nspell out the different sources of finding. When the government makes plan,\none of its major source of getting funds in the tax revenue. For a business\nperson, one of the sources of finance is the loan from bank. When various\nsources of funds are available then the planner must also decide as to how\nmuch fund to be collected from each of these sources.\nUse  of  the  human  resource  is  another  important  task  to  execute  the  plan\nproposal. The planner must estimate the type of man power and the number\nof persons required to carry out the task. A proper estimate on this requirement\nshould be given at the outset. Similarly proper estimate of physical resources\nshould also be provided. Physical resources include office buildings, vehicles,\nfurniture, stationeries etc.\n(vii) Once  the  resources  are  arranged,  implementation  and  execution  process\nstarts in an organize manner to achieve the desired goal. To make sure that\neverything is running smoothly and to rectify mistakes if any or to modify the\nstyle of working to accommodate any change, periodic review must be done\ntill the final achievement is realised.\n2.2  ECONOMIC PLANNING IN INDIA\nIndia  adopted  a  system  of  five  yearly  planning  to  address  its  various  socio-\neconomic problems.

To remind, these problems include mass\npoverty and inequality, low productivity in agriculture and storage of food grains,\nlack of industrial and infrastructural development etc. Since these are to be solved\nover the long period, Indian government adopted five year plan starting from first\nyear plan in 1951 development. The idea was to make a list of important problems\nto be solved keeping in view the given resources and the capacity to arrange the\nresources. Then make a review after five years of what has been done and rectify\nthe mistakes accordingly in the next five year plan period and so on.\nSome of the great architects of Indian planning include Jawaharlal Nehru, P.C\nMahalonobis, V.R Gadgil, V.K.R.V Rao. After becoming the first prime minister\nof independent India, Nehru established the Planning Commission in 1950. The\nmajor function of the Planning Commission was to formulate plans keeping in view\nthe  resources  of  the  country  and  suggesting  the  best  methods  to  utilize  them\neffectively and in a balanced manner. Planning commission prepared the first five\nyear plan (FYP) for the period 1951-1956.  By 2014, India has already experienced\nmore than sixty years of planning with eleventh five year plans being completed are\ntwelfth FYP continuing.\n2.3  OBJECTIVES OF PLANNING IN INDIA\nThe various objectives of economic planning in India are drawn keeping in view\nits socio-economic problems.  Accordingly the objectives as follows:\n1.   Economic growth\n2.   Increase in employment\n3.   Reduction in inequality of income\n4.   Reduction in poverty\n5.   Modernization of the economy\n6.   Ensuring social justice and equality.\nLet us discuss these objectives one by one .\n1.   Economic Growth : The objective of achieving economic growth implies that\nthe real national income and per capita income must grow every year at a\ntargeted rate. Real national income is the measure of national income at a given\nyears price or at a constant price. Real per capita income is the average income\nof individuals in the economy. It is argued that in order to achieve higher\nstandard of living for each individual /household and the society as a whole ,\nboth per capita income and national income must grow in real terms. Since\nincome represents purchasing power, increase in income will enhance the\npurchasing power of people and the country. When purchasing power will"

The country as a whole can pay for its purchases from abroad called\nimport. Increase in real income also means that the output level or quantity of\noutput is higher than before. Here output includes output in different sectors\nof the economy such as agricultural output, industrial output and services to\nsatisfy the needs of India’s growing population increase in output every year\nhas to be achieved. To achieve higher rate of output the economy must increase\nits rate of investment to create infrastructure and capital stock. Infrastructure\nincludes power projects, roads, railways, airports, ports, telecommunication\nnetwork, buildings etc. Capital stock includes plant, machinery, banking and\ninsurance etc. Investment in all these things is necessary to achieve economic\ngrowth in real income, hence the planners of the country set a target for growth\nin each five year plan keeping in view the growth of population and demand\nfor goods and services etc.\n2.   Increase in Employment: Employment refers to engagement of the labour\nforce in gainful economic activity such as production of goods and services.\nIncome is generated through the production process where the production\nprocess  involves  employment  of  factors  of  production  provided  by  the\nhouseholds. You know that factors of production include land, labour, capital\nand organization/entrepreneurship. These factors are owned by the households\nof the country. As factors are scarce resources and needed to produce goods\nand services, it is important for the government to create opportunities where\nin they can be properly used/utilized. The production capacity of an economy\ndepends  on  the  amount  of  the  factor  resources  it  possesses.  The  required\namount of output can be generated if these factors of production get employment.\nThe value of the output then can be distributed among the factors as their\nincome in the form of wage for labour, rent to the owner of land and building,\ninterest to the owner of capital and profit to the entrepreneur. If the country\nis not able to create employment opportunities to gainfully engage the factors\nof production, the required amount of output can not be produced and hence\nincome can not be generated. Take the example of labour resources in the\ncountry. You know that the population of the country supplies labour force\nwho are in the age group of 15 to 59 years. Every year due to increase in\npopulation the number of people in the labour force is also increasing. Most\nof them are also educated. If there is no enough scope to get employment then\nthey will remain unemployed and unutilized. Infact the unemployment situation\nin  India  is  very  bad.  Besides  causing  increase  in  consumption  without\ncorresponding increase in production, unemployment also is a cause of various\nsocial  problems  such  as  poverty  and  crime  etc.  So  planners  of  the  Indian\neconomy put creation of employment as a major objective of five year plans."

A large section of India’s population belong to lower income group\nand termed as poor where as a few are very rich with very high level of income.\nIncome disparity is a major concern of the social angle, women are the worst\naffected in terms of income standard irrespective of their caste or religion.\nSimilarly the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe population belong to the\nmarginalized section of Indian society as they are at the bottom of the pyramid\nof development. One of the major reasons of inequality in income is the unequal\ndistribution  of  asset  holding  such  as  per  capita  land  holding,  possession\nmovable and immovable property from inheritance etc. A majority of India’s\npopulation live in rural area and work in agriculture. But a few are big land\nlords and majority are marginal or small farmers and agricultural labourers.\nAgricultural labourers are so called because they do not have their own land"

Their situation in worse because of their own illiterary and\nlack of scope to organize themselves. One to their low income they do not have\nanything to begin to their reset generation on the otherhand landlords enjoy\nhigher returns to their property and due to existence of law of inheritance the\nproperty remains with their future generations. Hence, rich remains rich and\npoor remains poor in the country due to possession and lack of private property\nrespectively. India is badly affected due to this inequality . The poor people are\nnot able to support the market due to lack of purchasing power where too\nmuch purchasing power with the rich has caused wasteful consumption to\nincrease. Most of the social evils are created due to inequality. Hence, our\nplanners  aimed  at  reducing  the  inequality  in  income  distribution  through\nplanning.\n4.   Reduction  in  Poverty  :  Another  major  objective  of  planning  in  India  is\n“reduction In poverty”. At the time of independence more than fifty percent of\nIndia’s population was poor. By the year 2014, nearly 27 to 28 percent of\nIndia’s population is under poverty as per governments estimates. You will\ncome to know about the manner in which poverty is estimated in India in the\nlesson on poverty and employment. For the time being let us confine our notion\nof poverty to the situation where in an individual is unable to satisfy his/her\nbasic minimum needs of life. There are lot of people in the country who are not\neven getting a square meal a day. Lack of employment is a major cause of\npoverty . It is aggarated by unequal distribution of national wealth and income.\nPoverty is termed as a curse on human dignity and it has seriously tarnished the\nimage of India in the world. Developed countries do not count India seriously\ndue to its inability to remove poverty. It is proper planning to remove poverty\ncompletely from the country.\n5.   Modernisation of the Economy : India has been a country of continuous\nexploitation by foreign powers such as the Mughals who ruled for more than\ntwo hundred years and the British who also ruled the country for another two\nhundred years. The British in particular, left the country in dine poverty and\nunderdevelopment when they handed over power to Indian government in\n1947. Because of the historical reasons Indian economy could not rise from its\ntraditional level of functioning. It remained an agrarian economy and industrially\nbackward. There was no development in now technology and technological\nupgradation. Lack of modern technology is a major reason for Indian economy\nto suffer from low productivity in agriculture and lack of industrial development.\nAt the time of independence and for many more years after that, the major\ncontributor to India’s GDP because of underdeveloped industrial and service\nsector. Combined with his lack of better education and skill development of the\npopulation,  the  occupational  structure  has  also  remained  biased  towards\nagriculture. Hence, to reverse such trend it is necessary to change the structure"

This  can  be  done  by  modernization  of  the\neconomy.\n6.   Ensuring  Social  Justice  and  Equility  : Indian  planning  also  aimed  at\nachieving a socialistic pattern of society. It can be achieved by ensuring its\npopulation social justice and equity. In fact all the objectives said above are\nnecessary to achieve social justice. But the sufficient condition for sustaining\nsocial justice and equitable distribution of income is to introduce reforms in\nvarious  sectors  by  changing  the  age  old  systems  which  have  perpetuated\npoverty and inequality and obstructed development of industrial and service\nsector or caused low productivity in agriculture. So the planners thought to\nintroduce reforms in agriculture and economic policy so that they facilitate\ngrowth and equitable distribution of the benefits of development.\nINTEXT QUESTIONS  2.2\n1.

Each problem is complex in nature\nand cannot be solved in a short period.

Without proper planning it cannot be done.\nPlanning is also necessary to avoid wasteful expenditure, minimize cost meet the\ntarget in time and optimal use of resource.\n2.5  STRATEGY OF PLANNING\nBy strategy we mean the use of correct approach /method/formula for achieving\nthe target under planning. In the first plan period of 1951-56, no specific strategy\nwas adopted during this time the government of India gave more emphasis to\nagriculture  keeping in view the fact that majority of India’s population depend on\nagriculture and there was the immediate issue of adequate food grain supply to\naddress food shortage. The first five year plan was a great success as the targeted\ngrowth rate was achieved so India was in a position to adopt a long term strategy\nfor  planning  in  future.  The  development  strategy  was  accordingly  spelt  out\nexplicitly in the second plan period of 1956-61. The strategy was to give emphasis\non  –  1.  Industrialization,  2.  Within  industrialization  more  emphasis  on  heavy\nindustries.\n2.6    JUSTIFICATION OF THE STRATEGY OF\nINDUSTRIALIZATION\nIn order to address the problems related to poverty, unemployment, economic\ngrowth, self reliance etc. The Indian planners adopted the strategy of industrialization\nin the country in general and establishing heavy and basic industries in particular.\nThe arguments offered in favour of industrialization and heavy industries\nstrategy are as follows:\n1.   India’s population has been over depended on agriculture resulting in crowding\nof rural area, pressure on land, fragmentation of land holding, underemployment\nand unemployment with fixed amount of land available for cultivation, more\npopulation makes the amount of per capita availability of land very small or nil.\nThis has resulted in inequality in distribution of land and ultimately affecting\nagricultural production badly. Industrialization is the only answer to shift  the\nsurplus labour engaged in agriculture to industries and release the pressure on\nland.\n2.   Industrial activities provide more job opportunities than agricultural activities.\nSo industrialization will help getting employment for the jobless in the country.\n3.   Industrialization is necessary for the growth of agriculture itself . Industries\nuse  raw  materials  from  agriculture  and  agriculture  sector  needs  industrial\nequipment and machinery  such as pump set, tractor, electricity etc.\n4.   Establishment of basic and heavy industries must be given priority. Examples"

Every economy needs\nsuch  type  of  industries  because  they  procedure  machinery  and  equipment\nneeded to establish other industries which can produce consumer goods for the\nsatisfaction of wants. So the heavy industries are the backbone of the economy.\nIt  should  be  noted  that  after  the  adoption  of  heavy  industry  strategy  the\ngovernment  of  India  created  public  sector  to  establish  and  manage  such\nindustries. Some of the examples are steel authority of India limited (SAIL),\nBharat aluminium company (BALCO), Bharat heavy electrical limited (BHEL),\nNational aluminium company (NALCO), etc.\n5.   Besides heavy and basic industries, Indian government has also given emphasis\non developing the micro, small and medium industries. These industries are\ndefined on the basis of investment limit and can be established by private\nindividuals.  The  advantage  of  these  industries  include:  promotion  of  self\nemployment as well as generating employment furthers, use of local resources,\nreducing inequality of income as they can be owned by individuals etc.\n2.7 NEW ECONOMIC  POLICY\nAs said above, the heavy industry strategy was implemented under the ownership\nand management of the public sector. The government made budgetary provisions\nfor the public sector to create infrastructure and establish industries. The process\nwent on for more than three decades. However, an evaluation of the performance\nof the public sector by the government itself found that barring a few, more than\nhalf  of  the  public  sector  units  have  been  running  on  losses.  There  was  gross\nmismanagement and labour problems falling the public sector units. It was a major\nshock to the government to find all these short comings of public sector. The failure\nof the public sector on various fronts was seen as one of the major reasons for lack\nof  all round development of the country in the area of industrialisation, removal\nof poverty and unemployment etc. Hence in 1991, the central government came\nout with a new economic policy resolution. The main feature of this policy are:\n(i)    Liberalization\n(ii)   Privatization\n(iii)Globalization\nThe policy is also popularly called LPG model of development.\nMeaning of and Need for Liberalization\nLiberalization means withdrawal of controls and regulations by the government on\nestablishment and running of industries in the country. Till 1991, all the public\nsector  units  were  practically  under  the  government  even  if  they  were  called"

There  were  lot  of  interventions  by  the  ministries  of  the\ngovernment in functioning of the public sector. This resulted in politilization and\nfall in professionalism and inefficiency. In order to overcome this problem the\ngovernment decided to stop political intervention in the running of the public\nsector units by signing a memorandum of understanding. According to this the\nmanagement of public sector units will be given autonomy to function but they will\nalso be accountable.\nAnother important feature of liberalization is to do away with the licensing system.\nEarlier  it  was  mandatory  for  any  private  individual  or  organization  to  seek\npermission from the government to start any industrial activity. There was heavy\nrush and long queue before the window of the concerned government department\nto  get  a  license.  This  system  slowly  gave  rise  to  delays  in  getting  license.\nGovernment officials started taking bribes to clear files. Such corrupt practices\nbrought bad name to the government. So in 1991 government decided to abandon\nthe licensing system and allowed the interested individuals to start their industrial\nactivity without any permission. However, permission is still required only in case\nof strategic industries such as medicine, defence equipments etc.\nMeaning of and Need for Privatization\nPrivatization implies opening of the door of industrial activities to the private\nsector which was exclusively reserved for public sector only except nuclear enemy\nand defence. Since basic and heavy industries were strictly under public sector\nthere was no room for competition. The quality of product and services deteriorated\ndue to lack of competition from other companies. As a result the consumers were\nthe major looser because they did not get quality products and the delivery system\nand other services were also very poor. So the government decided to allow and\nencourage the entry of private sector in the areas earlier reserved for public sector\nonly. As a result private sector entry was seen in tele communication, civil aviation\netc. The government also decided to disinvest some of the public sector companies\nby selling part of their assets to public.\nMeaning of and Need for Globalization\nGlobalization is a process in which attempts are made by the different countries in\nthe world to allow free flow of goods and services, labour technology, investments\netc. India is a member of world trade organization (WTO) which is the nodal\nagency to promote globalization. In 1991 industrial policy, India adopted soft\nattitude  towards  foreign  companies  to  do  their  business  in  India  in  order  to\npromote competition. It also committed itself to abolish or reduce tariff on import\nof commodities. On the otherhand, India also adopted policies to promote exports.\nThe government also allowed foreign companies to hold 51 percent share or more"

As said earlier, there were certain\nobjective of economic planning which include: achieving economic growth in\nterms of increase in real national and per capita income, increase in the level of\nemployment,  removal  of  inequality  in  the  distribution  of  income  removal  of\npoverty, ensuring social and economic justice etc. By 2014, India has completed\n63 years of planning and has entered into twelfth plan period. It is high time to know\nthe achievements of planning keeping in view its objectives. Let us discuss them.\n1.   Achievements in Economic Growth\nAchieving  economic  growth  was  a  major  objectives  of  planning.  To  achieve\ngrowth it is necessary to achieve increase in national income and per capita income\nas well as increase in production of agricultural and industry sectors. A review of\ndifferent plans shows that, the first five year plan was a success as it achieved a\ngrowth rate of 3.6 per cent against a target of 2.1 percent growth rate in national\nincome. Then except for 5\nth\n and 6\nth\n plans, during the other plan periods i.e. from\nsecond to eleven five year plan the targeted growth rate in national income could\nnot be achieved.\nSimilarly, The per capita income has attained growth but the rate of growth has\nbeen very slow. For example : During the first 30 years of planning the per capita\nincome grew at a very slow rate of 1.2 per cent per year. Recently this growth rate\nhas increased to some extent. Coming to agriculture, the food grain production has\ngone up from 51 million tones at the beginning of the first plan to 257.4 million\ntones in 2011-12. Particularly the production of rice, wheat has been spectacular,\nbut production of pulses and oil seeds etc., has been below target.\nIn terms of industrial development, a major achievement has been the diversification\nof Indian industries. There has been expansion of transport and communications,\ngrowth in generation and distribution of electricity and considerable progress in\nsteel, aluminium, engineering goods, chemicals, fertilizers and petroleum products."

The  goods  worth  mentioning  here\ninclude-cereals, sugar, milk, egg, edible oil, tea, cloth and electricity.\n2. Creation of Infrastructure\nIndia has achieved a great deal in the area of creation of infrastructure. There has\nbeen  large  expansion  roads  and  railway  networks.  Domestic  air  travel  has\nincreased significantly. Expansion of irrigation and hydro-electric projects has\ngiven boost to agricultural production. There has been growth in establishment of\ntowns and cities due to increase in urban infrastructure. Communication network\nin the form of mobile telephony, internet has expanded tremendously.\n3.  Development in Education\nOne of the brightest areas of achievements of planning has been the development\nin education in India. There has been a significant increase in the enrolment of\nchildren at school level. There are 378 universities and 18,064 colleges in India\nwhich is a good development for higher education. India has also 1.52 lakh higher\nsecondary and 10.43 lakh primary and upper primary schools.\n4.  Development of Science and Technology\nAnother  significant  area  of  achievement  has  been  the  growth  in  science  and\ntechnology including the increase in technical and skilled manpower. India’s march\nin space research has been noticed by the developed countries. It has made impact\nin the field of nuclear energy as well. Today India’s Dependence on foreign experts\nfor consultation has reduced. On the contrary it is now able to send technical\nexperts to many foreign countries in the middle east, Africa etc.\n5.  Expansion of Foreign Trade\nDue to industrialization in the country, India’s dependence on import of capital\ngoods has delivered. Many items, which were imported earlier are being produced\ndomestically. Due to industrial progress, India is also able to export manufacturing\nand engineering goods.\nINTEXT QUESTIONS  2.4\n1.

Failure to Remove Poverty and Inequality completely :\nEven after more than sixty years of planning, India has not been able to remove\npoverty completely. More than 240 million people are still under absolute poverty\naccording to official estimates. The situation is worse in rural area. The government\nhas introduced many antipoverty measures. But they have not been very successful\nso far.\nSimilarly, there is no significant improvement in the distribution of income and\nasset holding resulting in existence of inequality. The number of lanless agricultural\nlabourers is very high as compared to the land holding population. The process of\nindustrialization  has  helped  some  big  industrial  houses.  This  has  resulted  in\nconcentration of economic wealth and power in few hands. This trend must be\nreversed if India wants to achieve equity and social justice.\n2.  Problem of Unemployment Persists :\nInspite of growth in income and output, India’s employment situation has not\nimproved much. Due to faster growth of population and labour force the situation\nhas worsened further. According to official estimates India’s unemployment rate\nis 6.6%. There is also huge backlog of unemployment due to lack of creation of\nrequired amount of jobs every year.\n3.  Failure to Curtail Corruption  and Black Money :\nExistence of rampant corruption in various public offices is a matter of grave\nconcern in India. Common person faces a lot of problem in getting things done\nwithout  giving  bribe.  Infact  corruption  has  become  a  major  political  issue  in\nelections. Various forms of corruption include paying or accepting bribe, non-\npayment  of  tax  to  government,  political  influence  to  get  contract,  secret\nunderstanding among sellers to increase price etc. Corruption has given rise to\nblack money which is not accounted anywhere but very much in circulation.

The most\nfundamental measurement used to evaluate the success in allocating the scarce\nresources is economic growth. Individuals monitor their income and the changing\nvalue  of  their  assets.  Businesses  track  their  profits  and  their  market  share.\nNations  monitor  a  variety  of  statistics  to  measure  economic  growth  such  as\nnational income, productivity etc. Moving beyond growth and productivity,\nsome economists argue that any assessment of the nation’s economy must also\ninclude measurements of distribution, equity, per-capita income etc.  Further, the\ncountry should also focus on other needs of a society, like environmental justice\nor cultural preservation to sustain the economic growth process and allows an\noverall human development in the economy through creation of more opportunities\nin the sectors of education, healthcare, employment and the conservation of the\nenvironment.\nOBJECTIVES\nAfter completing this lesson, you will be able to:\nzdefine the meaning of Economic Growth and Economic Development, and\ntheir differences;\nzexplain the concept of Sustainable Development and Human Development;\nzlist out the factors affecting Economic Growth; and\nzdescribe the broad Features of the Underdeveloped countries."

The increase in Per-Capita income is the better measure\nof Economic Growth since it reflects increase in the improvement of living\nstandards of masses.\nzEconomic Growth is measured by increase in real National Income and\nnot just the increase in money income or the nominal national income\n. In\nother words the increase should be in terms of increase of output of goods and\nservices, and not due to a mere increase in the market prices of existing goods.\nzIncrease in Real Income should be Over a Long Period: The increase of real\nnational income and per-capita income should be sustained over a long period\nof time. The short-run seasonal or temporary increases in income should not\nbe confused with economic growth.\nzIncrease in income should be based on Increase in Productive Capacity:\nIncrease in Income can be sustained only when this increase results from some\ndurable increase in productive capacity of the economy like modernization or\nuse  of  new  technology  in  production,  strengthening  of  infrastructure  like\ntransport network, improved electricity generation etc.\n3.2  ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT\nEconomic development is defined as a sustained improvement in material well\nbeing  of  society.\n  Economic  development  is  a  wider  concept  than  economic\ngrowth.  Apart  from  growth  of  national  income,  it  includes  changes  –  social,\ncultural, political as well as economic which contribute to material progress. It\ncontains changes in resource supplies, in the rate of capital formation, in size and\ncomposition of population, in technology, skills and efficiency, in institutional and\norganizational set-up. These changes fulfill the wider objectives of ensuring more\nequitable income distribution, greater employment and poverty alleviation. In\nshort, economic development is a process consisting of a long chain of inter-\nrelated changes in fundamental factors of supply and in the structure of demand,\nleading to a rise in the net national product of a country in the long run."

Do\nyou agree with the statement?\n3.4  SUSTAINABLE  DEVELOPMENT\nSustainable  development  is  development  that  meets  the  needs  of  the  present\nwithout compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\nSustainable development includes the protection of future economic growth and\nfuture development.\n In other words, it means a better quality of life for everyone,\nnow and for generations to come. Sustainable development includes the protection\nof  future  economic  growth  and  future  development.  Growth  is  essential,  but\nsustainable development requires it to be different. It must become more concerned\nabout the physical environment not only to present generation, but to the future\ngeneration also. It means that the current consumption cannot be financed for long\nby increasing economic debt and ecological imbalance which future generation\nwill pay.\n Sustainable development constantly seeks to achieve social and economic\nprogress  in  ways  that  will  not  exhaust  the  earth’s  finite  natural  resources.\nSustainable development is a process of development in which economic and other\npolicies are designed to bring about development which is economically, socially\nand ecologically sustainable. The concept thus is pro-people, pro-job and pro-\nnature. It gives highest priority to poverty reduction, productive employment,\nsocial integration and environmental regeneration.\nThe  sustainable  development  thus  requires\nzPreservation of Ecological Resources and greater use of renewable resources.\nzEncouragement to the use of environmentally-safe technologies for development\npurposes  i.e.  focus  on  reduction  of  all  kinds  of  pollution  involved  in  the\neconomic activities.\nzFormulation and implementation of policy framework for people-security and\nhuman justice, including ecological and economic security.\n3.5  HUMAN  DEVELOPMENT\nAccording  to  the  United  Nation’s  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  human\ndevelopment may be defined as “a process of enlarging people’s choices.” At all\nlevels of development, the three essential choices for people include to live a long\nand healthy life, to acquire better knowledge and to have access to resources\nneeded for a decent standard of living. If these essential choices are not available,\nmany other opportunities to improve the quality of life will remain inaccessible.\nHuman development has two dimensions: acquiring human capabilities and the use"

The\nbenefits of human development go far beyond the expansion of income and wealth\naccumulation because people constitute the very essence of human development.\nHuman development is about much more than economic growth. The economic\ngrowth focuses on the improvement of one option i.e. income or product while\nhuman development  focus  on enlarging all human options including education,\nhealth, clean environment and material well being. Thus, the options available for\nimproving people’s lives are influenced by the quality of economic growth in its\nwider sense, and the impact is by no means confined to quantitative aspects of such\ngrowth. In other words, economic growth needs to be seen as a means, albeit an\nimportant  one,  and  not  the  ultimate  goal,  of  development.  Income  makes  an\nimportant contribution to human well-being, broadly conceived, if its benefits are\ntranslated into more fulfilled human lives. But the growth of income is not an end\nin itself.  It is the quality of growth, not its quantity alone, which is crucial for human\nwell-being.\nThus, the concept of human development, is concerned mainly with enabling\npeople to enjoy a better life as the ultimate goal of human endeavor. Highlights that\nthis goal cannot be achieved solely through improvements in income or material\nwell-being.\nAs the 1996 Human Development Report put it, growth can be jobless, rather than\njob  creating;  ruthless,  rather  than  poverty-reducing;  voiceless,  rather  than\nparticipatory; rootless, rather than culturally enshrined; and futureless, rather than\nenvironment-friendly.  Economic  growth  which  is  jobless,  ruthless,  voiceless,\nrootless  and  futureless  is  not  conducive  to  human  development.  The  lack  of\nincome or income poverty is only one aspect of human impoverishment; deprivation\ncan also occur in other areas– having a short and unhealthy life, being illiterate or\nnot allowed to participate, feeling personal insecurity, etc. Human poverty is thus\nlarger than income poverty.\n3.6   MEASURING  HUMAN  DEVELOPMENT:  HUMAN\nDEVELOPMENT  INDEX  (HDI)\nAs stated earlier three dimensions of Human Development are capabilities of\npeople to lead a long and healthy life, to acquire knowledge and to have access to\nresources needed for a decent standard of living. The combined effect of various\ncomponents of human development is measured through Human Development\nIndex  (HDI).  The  HDI  contains  four  variables:  life  expectancy  at  birth,  to\nrepresent the dimension of a long, healthy life; adult literacy rate and combined\nenrolment  rate  at  the  primary,  secondary  and  tertiary  levels  to  represent  the\nknowledge  dimension;  and  real  GDP  per  capita  to  serve  as  a  proxy  for  the\nresources needed for a decent standard of living.

Human development is a better measure of economic development as it places\nhuman-beings at the centre stage of development. Discuss.\n3.7  FACTORS  AFFECTING  ECONOMIC  GROWTH\nThe  process  of  economic  growth  is  a  highly  complex  phenomenon  and  is\ninfluenced by numerous and varied factors such as political, social and cultural\nfactors. These factors are as follows:\nA.  Economic  Factors\n1.   Natural Resources: The principal factor affecting the development of an\neconomy is the natural resources. The natural resources include the land area\nand the quality of the soil, forest wealth, good river system, minerals and oil\nresources, good climate, etc. For economic growth, the existence of natural\nresources in abundance is essential. A country deficient in natural resources\nmay not be in a position to develop rapidly. However, the availability of rich\nnatural resources are a necessary condition for economic growth but not a\nsufficient one. In less developed countries, natural resources are unutilized,\nunderutilized or misutilised. This is one of the reasons of their backwardness.\nOn the otherhand countries such as Japan, Singapore etc. are not endowed\nwith abundant natural resources but they are among the developed nations of\nthe world. These countries have shown committment towards preserving the\navailable resources, putting best efforts to manage the resources, minimizing\nwaste of resources etc.\n2.   Capital  Formation:  Capital  formation  is  another  important  factor  for\ndevelopment  of  an  economy.  Capital  formation  is  the  process  by  which  a\ncommunity’s savings are channelised into investments in capital goods such as\nplant, equipment and machinery that increases nation’s productive capacity\nand worker’s efficiency thus ensuring a larger flow of goods and services in a"

The process of capital formation implies that a community does not\nspend whole of its income on goods for current consumption, but saves a part\nof  it  and  uses  it  to  produce  or  acquire  capital  goods  that  greatly  add  to\nproductive capacity of the nation.\n3.   Technological Progress: Technological progress is a very important factor in\ndetermining  the  rate  of  economic  growth.  Technological  progress  mainly\nimplies the research into the use of new and better methods of production or\nthe improvement of the old methods. Sometimes technical progress results in\nthe  availability  of  natural  resources.  But  generally  technological  progress\nresults  in  increase  in  productivity.  In  other  words,  technological  progress\nincreases the ability to make a more effective and fruitful use of natural and\nother resources for increasing production. By the use of improved technology\nit is possible to have greater output from the use of given resources or a given\noutput can be obtained by the use of a smaller quantity of resources. The\ntechnological progress improves an ability to make a fuller use of the natural\nresources e.g. with the aid of power - driven farm equipment a marked increase\nhas been brought about in agricultural production. The USA, UK, France,\nJapan and other advanced industrial nations have all acquired the industrial\nstrength from use of advanced technology. In fact economic development is\nfacilitated with the adoption of new techniques of production.\nEntrepreneurship\nEntrepreneurship implies an ability to find out new investment opportunities,\nwillingness to take risks and make investment in the new and growing business\nunits. Most of the underdeveloped countries in the world are poor not because\nthere is shortage of capital, weak infrastructure, unskilled labor and deficiency\nof natural resources, but because of acute deficiency of entrepreneurship. It is,\ntherefore,  essential  in  the  under-developed  nations  to  create  climate  for\npromoting entrepreneurship by emphasizing education, new researches, and\nscientific and technological developments\n4.  Human  Resources  Development:  A  good  quality  of  population  is  very\nimportant in determining the level of economic growth. So the investment in\nhuman capital in the form of educational and medical and such other social\nschemes is very much desirable. Human resource development increases the\nknowledge, the skills and the capabilities of the people that increase their\nproductivity.\n5.   Population  Growth:  Labor  supply  comes  from  population  growth  and  it\nprovides expanding market for goods and services. Thus, more labor produces\nlarger output which a wider market absorbs. In this process, output, income\nand  employment  keep  on  rising  and  economic  growth  improves.  But  the\npopulation growth should be normal. A galloping rise in population retards"

Population growth is desirable only in a under-populated\ncountry. It is, however, unwarranted in an overpopulated country like India.\n6.   Social Overheads: Another important determinant of economic growth is the\nprovision of social overheads like schools, colleges, technical institutions,\nmedical colleges, hospitals and public health facilities. Such facilities make the\nworking population healthy, efficient and responsible. Such people can well\ntake their country economically forward.\nNon-Economic  Factors\nNon-Economic factors that include socio-economic, cultural, psychological and\npolitical factors are also equally significant as are economic factors in economic\ndevelopment. We discuss here some of the essential non economic factors which\ndetermine the economic growth of an economy.\n1.   Political Factors: Political stability and strong administration are essential\nand  helpful  in  modern  economic  growth.  The  stable,  strong  and  efficient\ngovernment, honest administration, transparent policies and their efficient\nimplementation develop confidence of investors and attracts domestic as well\nas foreign capital that leads to faster economic development.\n2.   Social and Psychological Factors: Social factors include social attitudes,\nsocial  values  and  social  institutions  which  change  with  the  expansion  of\neducation and transformation of culture from one society to the other. The\nmodern   ideology, values, and attitudes bring new discoveries and innovations\nand consequently to the rise of the new entrepreneurs. The outdated social\ncustoms restricts occupational and geographical mobility and thus pose an\nobstacle to the economic development.\n3.   Education: It is now fairly recognized that education is the main vehicle of\ndevelopment. Greater progress has been achieved in those countries, where\neducation is wide spread. Education plays an important role in human resource\ndevelopment, improves labor efficiency and removes mental block to new\nideas and knowledge thus contributes to economic development.\n4.   Desire  for  Material  Betterment:  The  desire  for  material  progress  is  a\nnecessary precondition for economic development. The societies that focus on\nself-satisfaction, self-denial, faith in fate etc. limit risk and enterprise and thus\nkeep the economy backward.\nINTEXT  QUESTION  3.3\n1.

Regional  disparity  is  also  crucial  in  this\ncontext. Economic reforms, changes in the industrial policy and better utilization\nof available resources are expected to reduce the problem of unemployment and\npoverty. The governmental bodies are also required to initiate long term measures\nfor poverty alleviation. Generation of employment opportunities and equality in\nincome distribution are the two key factors that are of utmost important to deal\nwith the dual problem of unemployment and poverty.\nOBJECTIVES\nAfter completing this lesson, you will be able to:\nzexplain the meaning, types and important measures of unemployment;\nzidentify the causes of  unemployment;\nzknow  the  Government  policies  and  programmes  implemented  to  alleviate\npoverty and generate employment; and\nzevaluate the extent and causes of regional disparity in India.\n4.1  MEASUREMENT AND MAGNITUDE OF\nUNEMPLOYMENT IN INDIA\n4.1.1 Meaning and Types of Unemployment\nThe  population  of  any  country  consists  of  two  components  (i)  Labor  Force\n(ii) Non-Labor Force. Labor force means all persons who are working (i.e. being\nengaged in the economic activity) as well as those who are not working but are"

It means the labor force\nconsists of both employed and unemployed people.\nThe component of population which is not a part of the labor force is Non-Labor\nForce.  It  includes  all  those  who  are  not  working  and  are  neither  seeking  nor\navailable for work.\nUnemployment can be defined as a state of workless ness for a person who is fit\nand willing to work at the current wage rate. It is a condition of involuntary and\nnot voluntary idleness. Simply stated an unemployed person is the one who is an\nactive member of the labor force and is seeking work, but is unable to find the same.\nIn case of voluntary unemployment a person is out of job on his own accord or\nchoice, doesn’t work on the prevalent or prescribed wages. Either he wants higher\nwages or doesn’t want to work at all. The involuntary unemployment on the other\nhand is the situation when a person is separated from remunerative work and\ndevoid of wages although he is capable of earning his wages and is also anxious\nto  earn  them.  It  is  the  involuntary  idleness  that  constitutes  unemployment.\nInvoluntary unemployment can be further divided into cyclical unemployment,\nseasonal  unemployment,  structural  unemployment,  frictional  unemployment,\nnatural rate of unemployment, disguised unemployment and under employment.\n4.1.1.1 Cyclical Unemployment\nCyclical or demand deficient unemployment occurs when the economy is in need\nof low workforce. When there is an economy-wide decline in aggregate demand\nfor goods and services, employment declines and unemployment correspondingly\nincreases.  Cyclical unemployment mainly occurs during recession or depression.\nThis form of unemployment is most commonly known as cyclical unemployment\nsince unemployment moves with the trade cycle. For instance, during the recent\nglobal slowdown in late 2008, many workers around the globe lost their jobs.\n4.1.1.2 Seasonal Unemployment\nThis type of unemployment occurs in a particular time of the year or season and\nthus  is  known  as  seasonal  unemployment.  Seasonal  unemployment  is  most\ncommon in industries like agriculture, tourism, hotel, catering etc.\n4.1.1.3 Structural Unemployment\nStructural unemployment arises when the qualification of a person is not sufficient\nto meet his job responsibilities. It arises due to long term change in the pattern of\ndemand that changes the basic structure of the economy. The person is not able to\nlearn new technologies used in the new expanding economic sectors and they thus\nmay be rendered permanently unemployed. For instance, when computers were"

Although jobs were\navailable, there was a demand for a new kind of skill and qualification. So, persons\nwith old skills did not get employment in the changed economic regime, and remain\nunemployed.\n4.1.1.4 Frictional Unemployment\nFrictional unemployment occurs when a person is out of one job and is searching\nfor another for different reasons such as seeking a better job, being fired from a\ncurrent job, or having voluntarily quit a current job. It generally requires some time\nbefore a person can get the next job. During this time he is frictionally unemployed.\n4.1.1.5 Natural rate of unemployment\nThe sum total of frictional and structural unemployment is referred as the natural\nrate of unemployment.\n4.1.1.6 Disguised Unemployment\nThe unemployment which is not visible is said to be disguised unemployment. It\noccurs when a person doesn’t contribute anything to the output even when visibly\nworking. This happens amongst family labor especially in agriculture who are\nengaged on land but are not contributing to the given level of output. Thus their\nmarginal productivity is zero.\n4.1.1.7 Underemployment\nWhen a person is engaged in the economic activity but that fail to provide him fully\nin accordance to his qualification and efforts. Thus it is a situation in which a person\nis employed but not in the desired capacity whether in terms of compensation,\nhours, or level of skill and experience. While not technically unemployed the\nunderemployed often compete for available jobs.\n4.2  MEASUREMENT OF UNEMPLOYMENT\nUnemployment rate is the percent of the labor force that is without work. It is\ncalculated as below:\nUnemployment rate = (Unemployed Workers/Total labor force) × 100\nMeasurement of unemployment is a difficult task. In India, the most comprehensive\nand reliable data on employment and unemployment are compiled by the National\nSample Survey Organization (NSSO).

The following are some methods of measuring\nunemployment:\n(i)    Usual Principal Status Unemployment (UPS): This is measured as the\nnumber of persons who remained unemployed for a major part of the year.\nThe persons covered by the survey may be classified into those working and/\nor available for work in their principal activity, and those working and/or\navailable for work in a subsidiary activity, that is, a sector other than their\nprincipal activity. Hence, within the usual status concept, the estimates are\nnow derived on the usual principal status as well as the usual principal and\nsubsidiary status basis. The usual status unemployment rate is a person rate\nand indicates chronic unemployment, because all those who are found usually\nunemployed in the reference year are counted as unemployed. This measure\nis more appropriate to those in search of regular employment, e.g., educated\nand skilled persons who may not accept casual work. This is also referred to\nas ‘open unemployment’.\n(ii)   Usual  Principal  and  Subsidiary  Status  Unemployment  (UPSS):  Here\nperson is considered unemployed, if besides UPS, those available but unable\nto find work on a subsidiary basis during a year.\n(iii) Current Weekly Status Unemployment (CWS): This refers to the number\nof persons who did not find even an hour of work during the survey week.\n(iv)  Current Daily Status Unemployment (CDS): This refers to the number of\npersons who did not find work on a day, or on some days, during the survey\nweek.\nRates of unemployment differ based on different concepts. The UPS and UPSS\nmeasure reflect only long term unemployment spells. The CWS measure captures\nshorter unemployment spells, but ignores unemployment for less than a week. The\nCDS  measure  is  the  most  inclusive,  capturing  both  open  as  well  as  partial\nunemployment. The unemployment rate based on different measures is given\nunder the following table 4.1:\nTable 4.1: Unemployment Rate (%)\nYear2004-052009-102010-11\nUPSS2.32.02.2\nCWS4.43.63.7\nCDS8.26.65.6\nSource: NSSO Surveys, till 2014"

UPSS has remained more or less same between 2004-05 to 2010-11 at\nmarginally above 2 per cent. CWS declined from 4.4 per cent in 2004-05 to 3.6 in\n2009-10 and almost remained same at 3.7 in 2010-11.

Therefore, jobs in adequate number were not created.  Further,\neconomic growth by itself does not solve the problem of unemployment. In the\nrecent past there has been deceleration in the growth of employment in spite of the\naccelerated economic growth. This can be explained in terms of steady decline in\nthe degree of response of employment to change in output in all the major sectors\nof economic activity except in construction. According to T.S. Papola,  over a\nperiod of time, the output growth in agriculture and manufacturing sector has\nbecome more input and technology-intensive and less labor-intensive. Besides, the\nsectoral composition of growth is also an important determinant of unemployment.\nExcessive dependence on agriculture and slow growth of non-farm activities limit\nemployment generation.\n4.3.2 Increase in Labor force\nThere are two important factors that have caused an increase in the labor force\nwhich are as follows:\n(i)    Rapid Population Growth: Rising population has led to the growth in the\nlabor  supply  and  without  corresponding  increase  in  the  employment\nopportunities for the increasing labor force has aggravated the unemployment\nproblem.\n(ii)   Social Factors:  Since Independence, education among women has changed\ntheir attitude toward employment.  Many of them now compete with men for\njobs in the labor market.  The economy has however failed to respond to these\nchallenges  and  the  net  result  is  a  continuous  increase  in  unemployment\nbacklogs.\n4.3.3 Rural-Urban Migration\nThe unemployment in urban area is mainly the result of substantial rural migration\nto urban areas. Rural areas have failed to provide subsistence living in agriculture"

However,\neconomic development in cities has failed to create enough additional jobs for the\nnew  urban  entrants  to  the  labor  market.  Thus  only  some  of  the  migrants  are\nabsorbed in productive activities and the rest join the reserve army of  unemployed\nworkers.\n4.3.4 Inappropriate Technology\nIn India, though capital is a scarce factor, labor is available in abundant quantity;\nyet producers are increasingly substituting capital for labor. This policy results in\nlarger unemployment. Despite the abundance of labor, capital intensive technology\nis adopted in India mainly because of rigid labor laws. It is quite difficult to follow\neasy  hire  and  fire  policy  and  so  right  sizing  of  manpower  is  difficult  for  the\nenterprises. It is difficult to reduce the number of labor-Force. Further, the factors\nlike labor-unrest and lack of work-culture leads to the increased inefficiency of\nlabor and thus provide incentives to follow labor-saving technology by organizations.\n4.3.5 Defective Educational System\nThe present educational system has theoretical bias and has limited utility for\nproductive purposes. It lacks the emphasis on the development of aptitude and\ntechnical qualifications required for various types of work among job seekers. This\nhas created a mismatch between the need and availability of relevant skills and\ntraining, which results in unemployment, especially of youth and educated while\nshortage of technical and specialized personnel continues.\n4.3.6 Lack of Infrastructure Development\nLack of investment and infrastructure development limits the growth and productive\ncapacity of different sectors which leads to inadequate generation of employment\nopportunities in the economy.\n4.3.7 Lack of employability\nIndia faces poor health and nutrition situation among masses which reduces the\ncapacity of person to be employable and it causes unemployment.\nINTEXT QUESTION  4.1\n1.

The definition and methods of measuring poverty differs\nfrom country to country. The extent of poverty in India is measured by the number\nof people living below the Poverty Line.\n4.4.1. Poverty Line\nThe Poverty Line defines a threshold income. Households earning below this\nthreshold  are  considered  poor.  Different  countries  have  different  methods  of\ndefining the threshold income depending on local socio-economic needs. The\nPlanning Commission releases the poverty estimates in India.\nPoverty  is  measured  based  on  consumer  expenditure  surveys  of  the  National\nSample Survey Organisation (NSSO). A poor household is defined as the one with\nan expenditure level below a specific poverty line.\nEarlier, India used to define the poverty line based on a method defined by a task\nforce in 1979. It was based on expenditure for buying food worth 2,400 calories\nin rural areas and 2,100 calories in urban areas. In 2009, the Suresh Tendulkar\nCommittee defined the poverty line on the basis of monthly spending on food,\neducation, health, electricity and transport.\nThe Planning Commission has updated the poverty lines and poverty ratios for the\nyear 2009-10 as per the recommendations of the Tendulkar Committee. It has\nestimated the poverty lines at all India level as an MPCE (monthly per capita\nconsumption expenditure) of `. 673 for rural areas and `. 860 for urban areas in\n2009-10. So a person who spends ` 673 in rural areas and `. 860 in urban area per\nmonth is defined as living below the poverty line.\nBased on these cut-offs, the percentage of people living below the poverty line in the\ncountry has declined from 37.2 per cent in 2004-5 to 29.8 per cent in 2009-10. Even\nin absolute terms, the number of poor people has fallen by 52.4 million during this\nperiod. Of this, 48.1 million are rural poor and 4.3 million are urban poor. Thus\npoverty has declined on an average by 1.5 percentage points per year between 2004-\n5 and 2009-10. The annual average rate of decline during the period 2004-5 to 2009-\n10 is twice the rate of decline during the period 1993-4 to 2004-5 (Table).\nTable 4.2: Poverty Ratios (figures are in %)\nYearRuralUrbanTotal\n1993-9450.13145.3\n2004-0541.825.737.2\n2009-103320.929.8\nSource: Economic Survey 2013"

Low\nlevel of saving reduces the scope for investment; low level of investment yields low\nincome and thus the circle of poverty goes on indefinitely.\n4.5.2 Low Resources Endowment\nA household is poor if the sum total of income earning assets which it commands,\nincluding land, capital and labor of various levels of skills, cannot provide an\nincome above the poverty line.  The poor mainly consists of unskilled labor, which\ntypically does not command a high enough level of wage income.\n4.5.3 Inequality in the Distribution of Income and Assets:\nThe distribution of income and assets also determine the level of income. The\neconomic inequalities are the major cause of poverty in India. It means the benefits\nof the growth have been concentrated and have not “trickled down” sufficiently\nto ensure improved consumption among the lower income groups.\n4.5.4 Lack of Access to Social Services\nThe lack of access to social services such as health and education compound the\nproblems arising from inequality in the ownership of physical and human assets.\nThese services directly affect household welfare. The poor typically get much less\nthan a fair share of such services. This is partly because governments do not invest\nenough to ensure an adequate supply of these services and the limited supply is\nmainly availed by non-poor households. Further, the poor may not have adequate\naccess for a variety of other reasons like lack access to information about the\nexistence of such services, lack of knowledge and corruption.\n4.5.5 Lack of access to Institutional Credit\nThe banks and other financial institutions are biased in the provision of loans to the\npoor for the fear of default in the repayment of loans. Further, the rules regarding\ncollateral security, documentary evidences etc. present constraints for the poor to\navail loan facility from banks.  The inaccessibility to institutional credit may force\npoor to take credit from the landlord or other informal sources at a very high\ninterest rate and which in turn may weaken their position in other areas, leading,\nfor  example,  to  the  payment  of  abnormally  high  rental  shares  for  land,  or\nacceptance  of  abnormally  low  wages  in  various  types  of  “bonded  labour”"

In some cases poor people\ncannot make themselves free from the clutches of moneylenders. Their poverty is\nfurther accentuated because of indebtedness. Such indebted families continue to\nremain under the poverty line for generations because of this debt-trap.\n4.5.6 Price Rise\nThe rising prices have reduced the purchasing power of money and thus have\nreduced the real value of money income. The people belonging to low income\ngroup  are  compelled  to  reduce  their  consumption  and  thus  move  below  the\npoverty line.\n4.5.7 Lack of Productive Employment\nThe  magnitude  of  poverty  is  directly  linked  to  unemployment  situation.  The\npresent employment conditions don’t permit a reasonable level of living causing\npoverty.    The  lack  of  productive  employment  is  mainly  due  to  problems  of\ninfrastructure,  inputs,  credit,  technology  and  marketing  support.  The  gainful\nemployment opportunities are lacking in the system.\n4.5.8 Rapid Population Growth:\nThe  faster  population  growth  obviously  means  a  slower  growth  in  per  capita\nincomes  for  any  given  rate  of  growth  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  and\ntherefore a slower rate of improvement in average living standards. Further the\nincreased population growth increase consumption and reduces national savings\nand adversely affects the capital formation thereby limiting the growth in the\nnational income.\n4.5.9 Low Productivity in Agriculture\nThe level of productivity in agriculture is low due to subdivided and fragmented\nholdings, lack of capital, use of traditional methods of cultivation, illiteracy etc.\nThis is the main cause of poverty in the rural India.\n4.5.10 Social Causes\n(i)    Education: Education is an agent of social change. Poverty is also said to be\nclosely  related  to  the  levels  of  schooling  and  these  two  have  a  circular\nrelationship. The earning power is affected by investment in individual’s\neducation  and  training.  However,  poor  people  do  not  have  the  funds  for\nhuman capital investment and thus it limits their income.\n(ii)   Caste system: Caste system in India has always been responsible for rural\npoverty.

What do you mean by vicious circle of poverty?\n4.7 INEQUALITY IN INDIA\nIndia is a vibrant country with quite an impressive economic growth profile and\nas  expected,  improvement  in  economic  growth  and  per  capita  income  has\ntranslated, at least partly, into reduction in the level of poverty in the country. It\nis a fact that there has been a secular decline in the share of poor in the population.\nHowever, there exists a wide spread disparities in the levels of social-economic\ndevelopment between the different regions of the country. The huge differences in\nliving standards as measured by per capita incomes, across the States of India range\nfrom 12000 rupees per head in Bihar to nearly 100,000 rupees per head in Goa.\nThey are the product of history and past growth experience. There are also other\nrelated  disparities  in  the  levels  of  education,  literacy,  health,  infrastructure,\npopulation  growth,  investment  expenditure  and  the  structure  of  regions.  The\nregional disparity in the last decade shows that India has a vast array of richer and\npoorer regions with Goa being the richest region and Bihar the poorest. In 2010/\n11, Chandigarh was the richest, but Bihar remained the poorest. There are also\nsubstantial variations in the average annual growth rate over the period, ranging\nfrom an impressive 8.39 per cent in Chandigarh to a sluggish 2.71 per cent in\nJammu & Kashmir. Further, during this decade, the top four richest regions (viz,\nGoa, Chandigarh, Delhi and Puducherry) have high initial levels of GDSP (Gross\nDomestic  State  Product)  per  head  and  very  fast  growth  over  the  period  as\ncompared to the other regions.\n4.8   CAUSES OF GROWING REGIONAL DISPARITIES IN\nINDIA\n4.8.1. Historical Factors\nHistorically regional imbalance in India started from its British regime. British\nindustrialist mostly preferred to concentrate their activities in two states like west\nBengal and Maharashtra and more particularly to their metropolitan cities like\nKolkata,  Mumbai  and  Chennai.  They  concentrated  all  their  industries  in  and\naround these cities neglecting the rest of the country to remain backward."

We can know about the\nnature of things both quantitatively and qualitatively. Many times we can express\nthings better in quantitative terms, that is, in numbers. For example, by comparing\nthe per capita income of India and the United States, we can say that India is a\ndeveloping economy while United States is a developed economy.\nThe word ‘Statistics’ is derived from the Latin word ‘statis’ or the Italian word\n‘statists’ or German word ‘statistic.’ All these words mean a political state. In the\nolden days statistics was necessary for the proper functioning of the affairs of a\nstate. Thus, in those days Statistics was called as ‘science of state’ or ‘science of\nkings’ as it was mainly used by the state or kings. Today statistics is defined as a\nfield of study relating to the collection analysis, interpretation and presentation of\ndata. In this lesson you will learn about the meaning of statistics and its scope and\nits need in economics.\nOBJECTIVES\nAfter completing this lesson, you will be able to:\nzexplain the need and scope of statistics in Economics;\nzdescribe the importance of statistics in Economics;\nzknow the characteristics of statistical data;\nzcarry out statistical enquiry;\nzidentify sources of statistical data; and\nzexplain the functions and limitations of statistics."

There is need of\nstatistical data in every walk of life. No field of study is complete without the\nsupporting quantitative information about that field. Some of the ways in which\nstatistics is widely used in economics are as follows:\n(i)    In  Construction  of  Economic  Theories:  An  economic  theory  is  first\ndeveloped on the basis of what we observe in real life. It is then approved or\ndisapproved by the analysis of statistical data relevant to the observation. For\nexample, it is observed that consumers demand less at higher prices. This\nobservation takes the shape of a theory when it is confirmed from actual\nstatistical data that consumers really demand less at higher prices.\n(ii)   In Economic Planning: Statistics is an important tool of economic planning.\nPlanners use statistical data to formulate policies for economic development.\nFor example, India is an over populated country. However, the extent of over\npopulation can be revealed by data on population and resources available to\nsupport the population. Effective policies to control population can be framed\nonly after we know how much over-populated India is.\n(iii) In  evaluation  of  policies  of  the  government: It  is  not  only  enough  to\nimplement policies but also necessary to know whether the implementation\nhas been proper or not. Statistical data helps us to evaluate the policies of the\ngovernment.  For  example,  how  much  revenue  did  the  government  get\nthrough higher taxes? It is through statistical investigations that the Finance\nMinister  gets  feedback  on  the  taxes  paid  by  the  people  and  the  revenue\naccrued to the government.\n(iv)  To  reveal  the  structure  of  an  economy:  We  study  the  structure  of  an\neconomy with the help of data on population, natural resources, employment,\nnational income, production, exports, imports etc. The statistical knowledge\nabout these helps us to know about the structure of the economy and the\nchanges in the structure of the economy.\n(b) Scope of Statistics\nIn ancient times, statistics was used by the state for the purpose of administration.\nBut now a days, it is widely used as a tool of all sciences. There is hardly any field\nwhether  it  be  biology,  botany,  astronomy,  physics,  chemistry,  sociology,  or\npsychology where statistical tools are not used. The word statistics is used in  two\nsenses: (a) the plural sense and (b) the singular sense. In a plural sense it refers to\nquantitative information or simply statistical data. In singular sense, it refers to"

Here we are\nreferring only to the quantitative information about population. We are using the\nword statistics in the plural sense in this case.\nWhen we say that population of India was estimated through the census method;\nthat  the  figures  are  presented  in  the  tabular  form;  that  population  of  India  is\ncontinuously rising and that it is rising on account of fall in death rate, we are\nreferring to the methods of collection, presentation, interpretation of trend in data\nand analysis of data respectively. All these steps are statistical methods. Here we\nare using the word statistics in the singular sense.\nImportance of Statistics in Economics\nThere are number of economic laws which have evolved due to statistical analysis\nin the field of economics, e.g. Engel's law of family expenditure, Malthus theory\nof population etc. Let us understand the importance of statistics keeping in view\nthe various parts of economics.\n(a)Statistics and the study of consumption: Every individual needs a certain\nnumber  of  things.  He  spends  first  on  necessities,  then  on  comforts  and\nluxuries, which depend on his income.

How do the statistical data look like? Table 5.1\nis an example of statistical data.\nIt gives information about population of India.\nHere we are referring only to the quantitative information about population. We\nare using the word statistics in the plural sense in this case.\n5.2.1.1 Characteristics of Statistical Data\n(i)    Statistical data are aggregates of facts: A single observation is not statistics,\nit is a group of observations. For example, Ram scored 60 marks out of 100\nis not statistics, but a series relating to the marks of a group of students will\nbe termed as statistics. For example, when we say that Mohan, Ram, Mary and\nKarim scored 35, 60, 75 and 58 marks respectively, the group of figures\nbecome statistics. Now we can compare, analyse and draw some conclusions\nfrom these figures.\nFor example:\n1.    Highest marks obtained are 75.\n2.    Lowest marks obtained are 35.\n3.    Marks range between 35 and 75.\n4.    Average marks obtained = \n35   60    75   58\n4\n\u000e\u000e\u000e\n = 57 marks\n(ii)   Statistics are affected by multiplicity of causes : Generally the facts and\nfigures are affected by a number of factors working together. For example, the\nproduction of rice depends on rainfall, method of cultivation, seeds, manure,\nsoil fertility etc. but it is very difficult to study separately the effect of each of\nthese factors on the production of rice.\n(iii) Statistical data are numerically expressed : All statistics are numerically\nexpressed. Qualitative statements such as ‘the population of India is increasing\nrapidly’ or ‘India’s per capita income is low’ are not statistics unless they are\nassigned numerical values."

Data collected in an unsystematic manner\nwould lead to misleading conclusions.\n(v)   Statistical data must be obtained with reasonable degree of accuracy :\nStatistics are numerical statements which can be obtained with accuracy if the\nnumber of observations is small. Sometimes, when actual measurement of\nfigures is not possible in a particular field of inquiry, then method of estimation\nor approximation is applied. For example, if we say that there are 30 students\nin XI class of XYZ public school, the figure is 100 percent accurate if we apply\ncounting method. But, on the other hand, if we say that 20,000 people are\nwatching the cricket match, this figure can be obtained only by estimation\nmethod  i.e.  as  an  approximation.  But  even  this  estimation  must  have  a\nreasonable degree of accuracy to make sense.\n(iv)  Statistics  are  collected  for  a  predetermined  purpose  :  The  purpose  of\ncollecting data should be decided in advance.

These are the stages through which\nevery statistical enquiry has to pass through. We shall discuss these stages one by\none.\n5.2.2.1  Stages of Statistical Enquiry\nStudying statistics in the singular sense implies the knowledge of various stages of\nstatistical study.\n(i)    Collection of data: Collection of data is the first step of a statistical enquiry.\nStatistical data are mainly classified into primary and secondary data. Primary\ndata  are  data  collected  directly  through  survey,  directly  from  first  hand\nsources by means of surveys, observations or experimentations. These are\ndata that has not been previously published.\nSecondary data are data collected from other sources including published and\nonline resources. For example, Reserve Bank of India Bulletin and National\nAccounts Statistics are published data i.e. Secondary data. You will read more\nabout primary and secondary data in the next lesson.\n(ii)   Organisation of Data : Organisation of the data refers to the arrangement\nof data in such a form that comparison of the mass of similar data may be\nfacilitated and further analysis may be possible. An important method of\norganization of data is to distribute data into different classes or sub-classes\non the basis of their characteristics. This process is called classification of\ndata.\n(iii) Presentation of data : The presentation of data means exhibition of the data\nin such a clear and attractive manner that these are easily understood and\nanalysed. There are many forms of presentation of data of which the following\nthree are well known: textual or descriptive presentation, tabular presentation\nand diagrammatic presentation. You will study more about this in the next\nlesson.\n(iv)  Analysis  of  data  :  After  the  data  have  been  collected,  organized  and\npresented, they need to be analysed. Analysis of data is a technique through\nwhich significant facts from the numerical data are extracted. One of the most\nimportant objects of statistical analysis is to get one single value that describes\nthe  characteristic  of  the  whole  data.  Analysis  of  an  economic  or  other\nproblems is not possible without the use of certain statistical tools such as\nmeasures of central tendency like mean, median or mode."

After making analysis with the help of statistical tools, we interpret\nthe data to derive some conclusions in order to formulate certain policies.\nInterpretation must be done carefully, as wrong interpretation will lead to\nformulation of wrong policies and hence do more harm than good.\n5.3  FUNCTIONS OF STATISTICS\nMain functions of statistics are given below:\n(i)Statistics simplifies complex data: With the help of statistics a mass of data\ncan be presented in such a manner that they become easy to understand e.g.\nthe complex data may be presented in the form of totals, averages, percentages\netc.\n(ii)Statistics presents the faits in a definite form: By stating conclusions in a\nnumerical or quantitative form, we can achieve definiteness.\n(iii)Statistics provides a technique of comparison: By using statistical tools\nsuch as average ratios, percentages etc. data can be made comparable for\ndrawing conclusion.\n(iv)Statistics  studies  relationship:  Correlation  analysis  is  used  to  discover\nfunctional relationship between different phenomena e.g. the relationship\nbetween demand and supply, the relationship between advertisement and\nsales can easily be explained with the help of correlation analysis.\n(v)   Statistics helps in formulating policies: Many policies are framed on the basis\nof statistics like import, export, wage-policy etc.\n(vi)  Statistics helps in forecasting: The future behaviour of phenomena such as\nmarket situation for the future in predicted on the basis of available statistics\nof past and present.\n(vii) Statistics help to test and formulate theories: Statistical data and techniques\nare useful while testing theories e.g. whether increase in demand affects the\nprice can be tested by collecting and comparing the relevant data.\nLimitation of statistics\n(i)It does not study the qualitative aspect of a problem: Statistics studies\nonly the facts which can be measured quantitatively but qualitative phenomena\nlike honesty, intelligence, poverty etc. cannot be studies in statistics unless\nthese attributes are expressed in terms of numerals.\n(ii)It  does  not  study  individuals:  Statistics  studies  aggregates  of  facts  but\nindividual values of the observation like income of a family has no specific\nimportance.\n(iii)Statistical laws are true only on an average: Since the results are affected\nby a large number of cause, laws of statistics are not universally applicable."

In this lesson you will learn about the techniques of\ncollecting, organizing and condensing of data. These techniques are necessary for\nmaking the statistical data meaningful.\nOBJECTIVES\nAfter completing this lesson, you will be able to:\nzdistinguish between primary and secondary data;\nzlist the methods of collecting primary data;\nzgive some examples of sources of secondary data;\nzexplain the concepts of an array, frequency array and frequency distribution;\nzstate different methods of constructing frequency distribution; and\nzconstruct simple and cumulative frequency distributions from a given data.\n6.1  COLLECTION OF DATA\n(a) Primary vs. Secondary Data\nData can be collected in two different ways. One way is to collect data directly from\nthe respondent. The person who answers the questions of the investigator is called\nrespondent. Statistical information thus collected is called primary data and the\nsource of such information is called primary source. This data are original because\nit is collected for the first time by the investigator himself. For example, if the\ninvestigator collects the information about the salaries of National Institute of"

The\ninvestigator only adopts the data. Statistical information thus obtained is called\nsecondary data. The source of such information is called secondary source. For\nexample, if the investigator collects the information about the salaries of employees\nof National Institute of Open Schooling from the salary register maintained by its\naccounts branch, then it is secondary data for him.\n(b) Methods for collecting primary data\nThere are several methods for collecting primary data. Some of which are:\n1.   Direct personal interview : In this method investigator (also called interviewer)\nhas to be face-to-face with the person from whom he wants information. The\nperson from whom this information is collected to called respondent.\n2.   Indirect oral investigation : Under this method data are collected through\nindirect sources. Under this method questions relating to the inquiry are put\nto  different  persons  and  their  answers  are  recorded.  This  method  is  most\nsuitable  when  the  person  from  whom  the  information  is  sought  is  either\nunavailable or unwilling.\n3.   Questionnaire method : In this method a list of questions called questionnaire\nis prepared and sent to respondents either through post or given personally to\nthem. This method is suitable where the field of inquiry is wide.\nThere are some advantages of using primary data. The investigator can collect\nthe  data  according  to  his  requirement.  It  is  reliable  and  sufficient  for  the\npurpose of investigation. However, it suffers from disadvantages also in that\nit  involves  a  lot  of  cost  in  terms  of  money,  time  and  energy.  This  make\nunsuitable when field of enquiry is very very large. Many a times with some\nmodifications, same purpose may be served by using data collected by other\npersons or agencies.\n(c) Sources of secondary data\nAs already discussed secondary data are not collected by the investigator himself\nbut they are obtained by him from other source. Broadly, there area two sources:\n(a) Published data and (b) Unpublished data.\nI. Published Sources\nThere are certain agencies which collect the data and publish them in the form of\neither regular journals or reports. These agencies/sources are known as published\nsources of data."

He collects data and finds that marks obtained by 40 students\nin the class are:\n20252827343130323340\n43434043424342454347\n48464748464958545650\n535139383638353537\nPut yourself in the position of investigator. In which aspect of this data you will be\ninterested?  Perhaps  you  would  be  interested  in  knowing  the  highest  marks\nobtained by any student. You may also be interested to know the lowest marks\nobtained by a student. Another point of interest can be the marks level around\nwhich most of the students have obtained.\nThe above data are unorganized. To refine this data for comparison and analysis\nit should be arranged in an orderly sequence or into groups on the basis of some\nsimilarity.  This  whole  process  of  arranging  and  grouping  the  data  into  some\nmeaningful  arrangement  is  a  first  step  towards  analysis  of  data.  Data  can  be\narranged in two forms: (a) Arrays and (b) Frequency distributions.\n(a) Arrays\nA method of presenting an individual series is a simple array of data. An orderly\narrangement of raw data is called ‘Array’. Arrays are of two types: (i) Simple array,\nand (ii) Frequency array.\n(i)    Simple Array : A simple array is an arrangement of data in ascending or\ndescending order. Let us construct the simple arrays of the data about the\nmarks of 40 students. The data in table 6.1 is arranged in ascending order and\nin table 6.2 in descending order.\nTable 6.1: Ascending Array of the Marks obtained by 40 students in class\n20354247\n25364348\n27374348\n28384349\n30384350"

One, the highest marks\nobtained by any student are 58. Two, the lowest marks obtained by any student are\n20.\nOrganising the data in the form of simple array is convenient if number of items is\nsmall.  As  the  number  of  items  increase  the  series  becomes  too  long  and\nunmanageable. As such there is need to condense data. Making a frequency array\nis one method of condensing data.\n(ii)   Frequency Array :  Frequency  array  is  a  series  formed  on  the  basis  of\nfrequency  with  which  each  item  is  repeated  in  series.  The  main  steps  in\nconstructing frequency array are:\n1.    Prepare a table with three columns-first for values of items, second for\ntally sheet and third for corresponding frequency. Frequency means the\nnumber of times a value appears in a series. For example in table 6.1 the\nmarks 43 appears five times. So frequency of 43 is 5."

Class :\n Class is a group of magnitudes having two ends called class limits. For\nexample,  20-25,  25-30  etc.  or  20-24,  25-29  etc.  as  the  case  may  be,  each\nrepresents a class.\n2.   Class Limits : Every class has two boundaries or limits called lower limit (L\n1\n)\nand upper limit (L\n2\n). For example in the class (20-30) L\n1\n = 20 and L\n2\n = 30.\n3.   Class Interval : The difference between two limits of a class is called class\ninterval. It is equal to upper limit minus lower limit. It is also called class width.\nClass interval = L\n2\n – L\n1\n. For 30 – 20 =10.\n4.   Class Frequency : Total number of items falling in a class that is having the\nvalue  within  L\n1\n  and  L\n2\n  is  class  frequency.  For  example  in  table  6.4  class\nfrequency in class (40-45) is 10. Similarly in class (50-55) the frequency is 4.\n5.   Mid-Point/Mid-Value(M.V.) : The mid-value of the class interval of a class\nalso called as mid-point is obtained by dividing the sum of lower limit and upper\nlimit of the class by 2. It is the average value of two limits of a class. It falls just\nin the middle of a class is\n12\nL   + L\nM.V. = \n2\nFor example, the mid-value of class (20-30) is \n20   30\n2\n\u000e\n = 25\nConstruction of Frequency Distribution\nFrequency distributions can be constructed in many ways. We will explain here the\nconstruction of the following types:\n(a)   Exclusive series\n(b)   Inclusive series\n(c)   Open end classes\n(d)   Cumulative frequency\nWhile constructing a frequency distribution same steps are to be taken which we\nhave followed in the frequency array. The only difference is that we record classes\nlike (20-25), (25-30), (30-35)....(55-60) etc., in first column in place of absolute\nitems like 20, 25,..56,58 etc.\n(a) Exclusive series: In this type one of the class limits (generally upper limit L\n2\n)\nis excluded while making a tally sheet. Any item having the value equal to the upper\nlimit of a class is counted in the next class. For example, in a class of (20-25) all\nitems having the value of 20 and more but less than 25 will be counted in this class."

Can you arrange the following information\nin tabular form?\n“There  are  50  Science,  50  Commerce  and  50  Arts  students  in  a  college.  The\nnumber of students from poor families is same for each course and their total is 30.\nWhereas science and commerce courses are equally popular in rich families, yet the\nnumber of rich arts students is twice as much. In all 40 students are from the rich\nfamilies studying in the college. The majority of students are from middle class\nfamilies and their number is 80.”\nLet us arrange this information in tabular form. There are 150 students in all. A table\nleaves a more lasting impression on human mind than statements saying the same\nthing. As they say, a picture is worth 1000 words.\nTable 7.1: Distribution of students according to course and\neconomic status\nScienceArtsCommerceTotal\nRich10201040\nMiddle Class30203080\nPoor10101030\nTotal505050150\n(b) Purpose\nThe  purpose  of  a  table  is  to  simplify  presentation  of  related  data  and  make\ncomparisons  easy.

The data given in rows is read from left to right. For example,\nrow 1 shows that country A imports 70 from B and exports 73 to B. The data given\nin column B read from above to downwards. For example, column 2 shows that\ncountry A imports 70, 72, 74, 85 respectively from countries B,C,D and E.\n(c) Types of Tables\nBasically we have two types of tables (i) Reference or general purpose tables or\n(ii) special purpose or text tables. Let us discuss them one by one.\n(i)    Reference or general purpose tables: These tables are in a way a store of\ninformation with an aim of presenting detailed statistical data. From these\ntables we can derive smaller tables. Generally, statistical tables presented by\nGovernment of India and its various statistical agencies and departments are\nreference or general purpose tables.\n(ii)   Special purpose or test tables: These tables are smaller and can be obtained\nfrom reference tables. They aim to analyse a particular aspect so that we are\nable to bring out a specific point or answer a specific question.\n(d) Parts of Table\nParts (or elements) of a table vary from table to table depending upon the nature\nof data and purpose of a table. However, some points are common to all (see\nformat of table 7.3). They are:\nTable 7.3:  (.......... Title ..........) (in \n``\n``\n`. Crores)\nStub HeadColumn Head 1Column Head 2\nSub ColumnSub columnSub columnSub column\nheadheadheadhead\nStub EntriesMain Body of the Table (field)\nFootnote  (............................)\nSource of data (.................................)\n1.   Table Numbers: If more than one table has been used or presented at one\nplace, it is always better to give them numbers. It makes further reference to\nthem easy. This number is always indicated in the top for example Table 7-1,\nTable 7-2 etc.\n2.   Title: Title is to the table what heading is to an essay. It appears at the top of\na table and gives idea about what is contained in the main body of the table. The\ntitle should be brief and to the point. It is better if the title is presented in bold\nletters or capital letters. What is the title of Table 7-2?"

It clarifies the\ncontents of the table and unit of measurements like “in rupees crores” or “in\nlakh tons” or “in thousand bales of cotton” etc. It must be written in brackets\non right side (top) of the table immediately below the title. For example, in table\n7.2 the unit of measurement is rupees crores.\n4.   Stub: The stub consists of stub head and stub entries. Whereas stub describes\nthe stub entries down below it, each stub entry labels a given data placed in its\nrow. Both stub head and stub entries appear on the left hand column of the\ntable. Further, stub entries describe the column heads.\n5.   Main Body or Field: It is the most important part of the table and contains\nthe numerical information about which a hint is given in title. For example, if\nthe title is “Exports and Imports of Country A during 1995-96, it clearly shows\nthat the body of the table contains statistical/numerical information on value\nof exports and imports of country A with different countries.\n6.   Footnote: It  is  a  qualifying  statement  placed  at  the  bottom  of  a  table.  Its\npurpose is to explain omission or limitations of the data presented in main body\nof  the  table.  For  example,  if  the  data  for  a  year  is  not  available  then  it  is\nmentioned at the bottom of the table.\n7.   Source of Data: Last but not the least, it is essential to mention the source of\ndata presented in the table. It helps the reader to check the original source of\ndata  himself  and  get  more  of  it  on  the  subject.  This  also  makes  the  data\npresented in the table more reliable. It should mention information like title,\nedition, page number and source of publication etc.\nINTEXT QUESTION 7.1\n1.

The height of this bar shows the quantity of the variable we want to present.\nIt is also called one dimensional diagram because only height of the bar is important\nand its base or width is not taken into account. To make them look more beautiful,\nbars are either coloured or shaded in different ways.\nTypes of bar charts:\nThere are two types of bar charts (a) simple and (b) components.\n(a) Simple bar charts\nSimple bar charts can be (i) Single bar charts, and (ii) Multiple bar charts.\n(i)    Single bar charts: We can either have vertical bars (figure 7.1) or horizontal\nbars (figure 7.2).

States are represented on X axis and number of\ncars on the Y axis. As per the data given in table 7.4 each bar (rectangle with\nsame base) is raised accordingly to the value of the variable (here the number\nof cars registered). For example, rectangle representing State A is raised upto\n8,000, for State B upto 10,000 and for State C upto 4,000 (see Fig. 7.1).\nIn case we prefer to use horizontal bars, we represent States on Y-axis. Here\nthe bars (rectangles) are drawn horizontally upto 8,000, 10,000 and 4,000\ncars respectively for the three States A, B and C.

In such cases a simple bar diagram\nis not suitable.  We have to use what is known as multiple bar diagram. Here\nthe number of bars for each year of region or zone is equal to the number of\nvariables (data) to be represented. For example, imports and exports will be\nrepresented by two bars; selling price, cost price and profits by three bars and\nso on. Normally we do not take more than three bars because it becomes\ncomplicated. The method of drawing bars is same as explained for simple bar\ndiagrams.  Two  examples  of  multiple  bar  diagrams  are  presented  below\n(figure-7.3 based on table 7.5 and figure 7.4 based on Table 7.6).\nTable 7.5: Imports and Exports of Country ‘X’ during 2009 to 2013\n(\n``\n``\n`.

For example, students of a particular\ncollege may be put in three categories-Science students, Commerce students and\nArts students. Or exports of India may be classified as to USA.

As such a pie diagram is shown in percentage terms.\nSteps in the construction of pie diagram\nStep 1.\nFind the value of each category or component or group as percentage of\ntotal of all categories or components or groups.\nStep 2.Calculate degree of the angle formed by each category or component or\ngroup by the formula given below.\nDegree for a particular category/component/group\n = \nValue of the group\n360\nTotal of all groups\nuq\nStep 3.Take a circle of a suitable size and draw radius.\nStep 4.Now draw angles calculated in step 2 with the help of a protractor.\nStep 5.Shade  or  colour  different  segments  suitably  or  make  the  distinctions\nbetween different categories or components or groups.\nStep 6.For each category or component or group put the percentage in the pie\ndiagram as shown in figure 7.6.\nLet us now take an imaginary example to illustrate the construction of a pie-\ndiagram.\nExample: From the monthly budget of an industrial worker of Mumbai Industrial\nArea, it was found that the family spent `. 360 on food, `. 108 on clothing, `. 90\non housing, `. 24 on comforts, `. 12 on education and entertainment and `. 6 on\nmiscellaneous items.

Time is represented on the X axis and\nproduction on the Y axis. Time and production are two variables in this graph. It\nis production which changes with time. In other words as time passes production\nis affected and it increases or decreases or may remain constant. Since production\nchanges with time, it is said to be dependent on time. Production is, therefore,\ntreated as a dependent variable. Time is not influenced by production and therefore\ntaken as an independent variable.\nPoint A on the line graph (also called curve) shows that production of crude oil in\ncountry ‘X’ in the year 2009-10 was 77.22 million tones. Similarly points B, C and\nD show production levels in the subsequent years. The upward rising curve from\nleft to right indicates that production of coal oil in Country ‘X’ is constantly rising\nsince 2009-10.\nIt is possible to show two or more comparable dependent variables on a time series\nline graph. In that case each dependent variable will be recorded on a separate\ncurve.

It aims to provide an\naccurate description of the entire data. It is the single value that is most typical/\nrepresentative of the data. Since such typical values tend to lie centrally within a\nset of observations when arranged according to magnitudes, averages are called\nmeasures of central tendency.

But  in  practice,  there  are  many  cases  where  relative\nimportance should be given to different items. When the mean is computed by\ngiving each data value a weight that reflects its importance, it is referred to as a\nweighted mean. When data values vary in importance, the analyst must choose the\nweight that best reflects the importance of each value. If w\n1\n, w\n2\n, w\n3\n, ... w\nN\n are\nweights of N observations in a series X\n1\n, X\n2\n, X\n3\n, ...

All  values  in  the  series  are  used  in  the\ncalculation of mean, so it can be regarded as more representative of the entire data\nset. However, mean is affected by extreme items i.e. very high or a very low value\nin the data set. Thus the mean may be rather lower or higher than most of the values\nin the data set and so become unrepresentative of the entire data. Mean cannot be\ncalculated in the open-ended frequency distribution.\n8.3  MEDIAN\nMedian is the positional value that divides the series into two equal parts in such\na way that half of the items lie above this value and the remaining half lie below this\nvalue. In Connor’s words - “The median is that value of the variable which divides\nthe group into two equal parts, one part comprising all values greater and the other\nall values lesser than the median.”  Median is called a positional average because\nit is based on the position of a given observation in a series arranged in an ascending\nor descending order and position of the median is such that equal number of items\nlie on either side of it. Median is denoted by Med. or M\nd\n.\n8.3.1  Computation of Median in case of Individual Series\nThe steps involved in the calculation of median are as follows:\nStep 1:Arrange the data in ascending or descending order."

For\nexample, a manufacturer would like to know the size of shoes that has maximum\ndemand or style of the shirt that is more frequently demanded. Here, Mode is the\nmost appropriate measure. Mode is the value which is repeated the highest number\nof times in the series. It is the size of that item which possesses the maximum\nfrequency.\n8.5.1 Computation of Mode in case of Ungrouped Data/ Individual series\nThe mode of this series can be obtained by mere inspection. The number which\noccurs most often is the mode.\nNote that if in any series, two or more numbers have the maximum frequency, then\nthe mode will be difficult to calculate. Such series are called as Bi-modal, Tri-\nmodal or Multi-modal series."

While preparing this table\ntake the column numbers as rows and the values of the variable as columns. Now for\neach column number see the highest total in the grouping table (Which is marked with\na circle) and mark the corresponding values of the variable to which the frequencies\nare related by using bars in the relevant boxes.

In order to find\nout  the  mode  we  need  one  step  more  than  those  used  for  discrete  series.  As\nexplained in the discrete series, modal class is determined by inspection or by\npreparing grouping and analysis tables.  The steps involved are:\n1.   Determine the modal class which as the maximum frequency.\n2.   Value of the mode can be calculated by the formula :\n10\n1\n102\nf f\nModei\n2f ff\nl\n−\n=+×\n−−\nl\n1\n = lower limit of the modal class\nf\n1\n = frequency of the modal class\nf\n0\n = frequency of the preceeding the modal class\nf\n2\n = frequency of the succeeding the modal class\ni = class interval of the modal class\nNote: 1.It may be noted that in case of continuous series, class intervals should be\nequal and series should be exclusive to calculate the mode. If the given series is\ninclusive and has unequal class interval then the same has to be converted into\nexclusive series and series with equal class interval.\n2. If mid points are given, class intervals are to be obtained.\nExample 17: From the following data calculate mode:\nAge (in years) :20-25   25-30  30-35   35-40   40-45   45-50   50-55   55-60\nNo. of Persons :5070801501801207050"

In the former case we\nconsider the range, Quartile Deviation, standard deviation etc. In the latter case\nwe consider the coefficient of range, coefficient quartile deviation, the coefficient\nof variation etc.\n9.1.1  Absolute and Relative Measures of Dispersion\nThe dispersion of a series may be measured either absolutely or relatively. If the\ndispersion is expressed in terms of the original units of the series, it is called\nabsolute measure of dispersion. The disadvantage of absolute measure of dispersion\nis that it is not suitable for comparative study of the characteristics of two or more\nseries.\nFor example if the data is expressed in kilograms then the absolute variation will\nalso be expressed in kilograms but if the same data is expressed in grams then the\nvariation  will  appear  1000  times  more.  So  for  comparison  point  of  view  it  is\nnecessary to calculate the relative measures of dispersion which are expressed as\npercentage  form  (i.e.  unitless  number).  These  types  of  expressions  are  called\ncoefficients of dispersion. Each absolute measure of dispersion has a relative\nmeasure of dispersion.\n9.2MEASURES  AND  METHODS  OF  COMPUTING\nDISPERSION\nThe following are the important measures of dispersion:\n1.   Range\n2.   Quartile deviation or Semi-Inter quartile range.\n3.   Mean deviation\n4.   Standard deviation\n5.   Lorenz Curve"

Many a time, we come across situations which\ninvolve the study of association among two or more variables. For example we\nmay find that there is some relationship between the two variables such as amount\nof rain fall and production of wheat; figures of accidents and number of motor cars\nin a city; money spent on advertising and sales. On the other hand, if we compare\nthe figures of rainfall in India and the production of cars in Japan, we may find that\nthere is no relationship between the two variables. If there is any relation between\ntwo variables i.e. when one variable changes the other also changes in the same or\nin the opposite direction, we say that the two variables are correlated.\nOBJECTIVES\nAfter completing this lesson, you will be able to:\nzexplain the meaning of the term correlation;\nzexplain the relationship between two variables;\nzcalculate the different measures of correlation; and\nzanalyze the degree and direction of the relationships.\n10.1  MEANING OF CORRELATION\nCorrelation refers to the associations between variables. When an association\nexists between two variables, it means that the average value of one variable\nchanges as there is a change in the value of the other variable. A correlation is the\nsimplest type of association. When a correlation is weak, it means that the average\nvalue of one variable changes only slightly (only occasionally) in response to\nchanges in the other variable. If there is no association, it means that there is no"

A positive\ncorrelation means that as one variable increases the other variable increases, e.g.\nHeight of a child and age of the child. Negative correlation implies as one variable\nincreases the other variable decrease, e.g. value of a car and age of the car.\n10.2  CORRELATION AND CAUSATION\nThe correlation between two variables measures the strength of the relationship\nbetween them but it doesn’t indicate the cause and effect relationship between the\nvariables.  Correlation  measures  co-variation,  not  causation.  Causation  means\nchanges in one variable affects/ causes the changes in other variable. In other\nwords, just because two events or things occur together does not imply that one\nis the cause of the other. A positive “linear” correlation between two variables say\nX and Y implies that high values of X are associated with high values of Y, and that\nlow values of X are associated with low values of Y. It does not imply that X causes\nY. for example, a high degree of positive correlation may be obtained between the\nsize of arms of children and their reasoning ability i.e. children with longer arms\nreason better than those with shorter arms, but there is no causal connection here.\nChildren with longer arms reason better because they’re older!  In this example the\ncommon third factor ‘age’ is responsible for the high correlation between size of\narms  and  reasoning  ability.  This  refers  to  spurious  correlation.  Similarly  a\nResearcher found a high degree of positive correlation between the number of\ntemple goers and the number of burglaries committed in different towns.  An\nexplanation that more temple goers means more empty houses or attending temple\nmakes  people  want  to  rob  would  be  a  logical  fallacy.  Instead  the  third  factor\npopulation is causing this relationship. The highly populated area tends to have\nmore temple goers and also case of burglaries. The following table 11.1 provides\nsome interesting examples of influence of third variable on correlation between\nvariables.\nTable 10.1: Spurious Correlation and Influence of Third Variable.\nObserved Spurious Correlation\nPositive Correlation between Amount\nof  ice  cream  sold  and  deaths  by\ndrowning at the beach during summer.\nShoe size and reading performance for\nelementary school children.\nNumber  of  doctors  in  region  and\nnumber of people dying from disease.\n Influence of Third Variable.\nSummer  Season:\n  Ice  cream  sales\nand drowning tend to be high during\nthe warm months of the year.\nAge: Older children have larger shoe\nsizes and read better.\nPopulation density: In highly dense\nareas,  there  are  more  doctors  and\nmore people die."

However, it is fairly obvious just from\nlogical thought that there is likely to be no causal relationship between the two.\nThat is, the importing of oranges does not cause traffic fatalities. Conversely, if we\nstopped importing oranges, we would not expect the number of traffic fatalities to\ndecline. It may be a sheer coincidence that a high degree of correlation is obtained\nbetween them.\n10.3  TYPES OF CORRELATION\nCorrelation may be:\n1.   Positive and negative correlation\n2.   Linear and non-linear correlation\nA) If two variables change in the same direction (i.e. if one increases the other\nalso increases, or if one decreases, the other also decreases), then this is called a\npositive correlation. For example: Advertising and sales.\nSome other examples of series of positive correlation are:\n(i)    Heights and weights;\n(ii)Household income and expenditure;\n(iii)Price and supply of commodities;\n(iv)Amount of rainfall and yield of crops.\nINTEXT QUESTIONS  10.1\n1.

If the graph is in a straight line, the correlation is called a “linear\ncorrelation” and if the graph is not in a straight line, the correlation is non-linear\nor curvi-linear.\nFor example, if variable x changes by a constant quantity, say 20 then y also changes\nby a constant quantity, say 4. The ratio between the two always remains the same\n(1/5 in this case). In case of a curvi-linear correlation this ratio does not remain\nconstant."

On the basis of the coefficient of correlation we\ncan also determine whether the correlation is positive or negative and also its\ndegree or extent.\n1.   Perfect correlation: If two variables change in the same direction and in the\nsame proportion, the correlation between the two is perfect positive. According\nto Karl Pearson the coefficient of correlation in this case is +1. On the other\nhand,  if  the  variables  change  in  the  opposite  direction  and  in  the  same\nproportion, the correlation is perfect negative. Its coefficient of correlation is\n-1. In practice we rarely come across these types of correlations.\n2.   Absence of correlation: If two series of two variables exhibit no relations\nbetween them or change in one variable does not lead to a change in the other\nvariable,  then  we  can  firmly  say  that  there  is  no  correlation  or  absurd\ncorrelation  between  the  two  variables.  In  such  a  case  the  coefficient  of\ncorrelation is 0.\n3.   Limited degrees of correlation: If two variables are not perfectly correlated\nor there is a perfect absence of correlation, then we term the correlation as\nLimited correlation.\nThus Correlation may be positive, negative or zero but lies with the limits ± 1.  i.e.\nthe   value of r  is such that -1 ≤ r ≤ +1.  The + and – signs are used for positive\nlinear correlations and negative linear correlations, respectively."

Today  we  use  index  numbers  for  cost  of  living,  industrial  production,\nagricultural production, imports and exports, etc. Index numbers are the indicators\nwhich measure percentage changes in a variable (or a group of variables) over a\nspecified time.\nOBJECTIVES\nAfter completing this lesson, you will be able to:\nzdescribe the term index and appreciate its uses;\nzdifferentiate between a weighted and unweighted index;\nzconstruct and interpret a  Laspeyer’s price index;\nzconstruct and interpret a Paasche’s price index;\nzconstruct and interpret a value index;\nzexplain how the Consumer Price Index is constructed and interpreted;\nzexplain how industrial production index is constructed; and\nzunderstand its limitations.\n11.1  MEANING OF INDEX NUMBER\n“An  index  number  is  a  statistical  measure,  designed  to  measure  changes  in  a\nvariable, or a group of related variables”.\n“Index number is a single ratio (or a percentage) which measures the combined\nchange of several variables between two different times, places or situations”."

An index number is used to measure changes in prices\npaid for raw materials; numbers of employees and customers, annual income and\nprofits, etc.\nIf the index number is used to measure the relative change in just one variable, such\nas hourly wages in manufacturing, it is referred to as a simple index. An index\nnumber can  also be used to measure changes in the value of the group of  variables\nsuch as prices of specified list of commodities, volume of production in different\nsectors of an industry, production of various agricultural crops, cost of living etc,\nit is referred to as composite index. Index number measures average change in a\ngroup of related variables over two different situations such as prices of specified\nlist  of  commodities,  volume  of  production  in  different  sectors  of  an  industry,\nproduction of various agricultural crops, cost of living etc. Index number does not\nindicate that the change is uniform for all commodities or group of related variables\nused to calculate it. It may be noted that in case of, say,  Price Index,  price of  of\nsome of the items may be  rising, while it is falling in other items. Price index will\nonly indicate the average change in the price of group of related commodities.\nConventionally, index numbers are expressed in terms of percentage. Of the two\nperiods, the period with which the comparison is to be made, is known as the base\nperiod. The value in the base period is given the index number 100.  Suppose the\nchange in price in the year 2013 is measured in comparison to the year 2000, then\n2000 become the base year and 2013 becomes the current year. For Example By\nsaying that the  price index for the year 2013 is 125, taking base year as 2000, it\nmeans that there is an increase of 25% in the general price as compared to the\ncorresponding figure for the year 2000. Price index numbers measure and permit\ncomparison of the prices of certain goods. Quantity index numbers measure the\nchanges in the physical volume of production, construction or employment.\n11.2  CHARACTERISTICS OF INDEX NUMBERS\nFollowing are some of the important characteristics of index numbers:\nzIndex numbers are a special type of average that provides a measurement of\nrelative changes in the level of a certain phenomenon from time to time. It is\na special type of average because it can be used to compare two or more series\nwhich are composed of different types of items or even expressed in different\ntypes of units.\nzIndex numbers are expressed in terms of percentages to show the extent of\nrelative change.\nzIndex numbers measure relative changes. They measure the relative change in\nthe value of a variable or a group of related variables over a period of time or\nbetween places."

Index numbers measure the level\nof business and economic activities and are therefore helpful in gauging the\neconomic status of the country. Index number is a special type of averages\nwhich helps to measure the economic fluctuations on price level, money\nmarket, economic cycle like inflation, deflation etc.\n(ii)Index numbers helps in formulating suitable economic policies and planning\netc. Many of the economic and business policies are guided by index numbers.\nFor  example,  while  deciding  the  increase  of  DA  of  the  employees;  the\nemployers have to depend primarily on the cost of living index. If salaries or\nwages are not increased according to the cost of living it leads to strikes, lock\nouts etc. The index numbers provide some guide lines that one can use in\nmaking decisions.\n(iii)Index  numbers  are  used  in  studying  trends  and  tendencies.  Since  index\nnumbers are most widely used for measuring changes over a period of time,\nthe  time  series  so  formed  enable  us  to  study  the  general  trend  of  the\nphenomenon under study.\n(iv)Index  numbers  are  useful  in  forecasting  future  economic  activity.  Index\nnumbers are used not only in studying the past and present workings of our\neconomy but also important in forecasting future economic activity.\n(v)Index   numbers   measure   the   purchasing   power   of   money.\nThe cost of living index numbers determine whether the real wages are rising\nor falling or remain constant. The real wages can be obtained by dividing the\nmoney wages by the corresponding price index and multiplied by 100. Real\nwages helps us in determining the purchasing power of money.\n11.4  CONSTRUCTION OF AN INDEX NUMBER:\nThe various methods of construction of Index numbers are explained through price\nindex  numbers.  The  methods  of  construction  of  price  index  numbers  can  be\nclassified into broad categories as shown below:"

For example, an index whose purpose is to measure consumer price\nindex, should not include wholesale rates of items and the index number meant for\nslum-colonies should not consider luxury items like A.C., Cars refrigerators, etc.\nSelection of Items\nAfter the objective of construction of index numbers is defined, only those items\nwhich are related to and are relevant with the purpose should be included.\nChoice of Average\nAs index numbers are themselves specialized averages, it has to be decided first as\nto which average should be used for their construction. The arithmetic mean, being\neasy  to  use  and  calculate,  is  preferred  over  other  averages  (median,  mode  or\ngeometric  mean).  In  this  lesson,  we  will  be  using  only  arithmetic  mean  for\nconstruction of index numbers.\nAssignment of weights\nProper importance has to be given to the items used for construction of index\nnumbers. It is universally agreed that wheat is the most important cereal as against\nother cereals, and hence should be given due importance.\nChoice of Base year\nThe index number for a particular future year is compared against a year in the near\npast, which is called base year. It may be kept in mind that the base year should be\na normal year and economically stable year.\n11.7  CONCLUSION\nAn index number is a statistical measure, designed to measure relative changes in\na variable(s) with time/geographical location/other criteria. Index Numbers can be\ncalculated for price, quantity, volume etc.The index numbers need to be  interpreted\ncarefully as there are several methods of calculating the index number. The items"
